# Projectors

🖥️🎥🔌💡🔗

## Introduction

Projectors are display devices used to share information with people in the same location. Troubleshooting projectors involves understanding their connectors, cables, device drivers, lighting, and calibration.

## Connectors and Cables

To connect a computer to a projector, you will use a display cable such as:

- VGA
- DVI
- HDMI
- DisplayPort

When you connect a projector to a computer, the operating system will detect the new display. Depending on the computer's video adapter, the new display can be extended or mirrored like a second monitor.

- MacOS: [How to connect one or more external displays with your Mac](link)
- Ubuntu: [How to connect another monitor to your computer](link)

Display issues with projectors often stem from worn-out or damaged connectors and cables. Always consider this possibility if the projection display flickers or disappears.

## Device Drivers

If your computer does not recognize the projector's display resolution correctly, it may default to a low-resolution VGA mode. In such cases, your computer may require a device driver for the projector. Refer to the support website of the projector's manufacturer for driver information.

## Lighting

Projectors traditionally use expensive, hot, and bright incandescent bulbs or lamps. If a projector overheats, it will shut down for safety. Additionally, if the lamp burns out, the projector will either not work or shut down. Many projectors now utilize LED lights, which have fewer overheating issues and longer lifespans compared to incandescent lamps.

## Calibration

When a projector is installed, reset, or moved, it may require calibration to ensure proper image projection. If the projected image appears skewed or keystoned, recalibration of the projector geometry might be necessary. Calibration involves focusing the image and making adjustments to achieve a square image aligned with the projection surface.

Remember, every projector is unique and may have specific requirements for calibration.
