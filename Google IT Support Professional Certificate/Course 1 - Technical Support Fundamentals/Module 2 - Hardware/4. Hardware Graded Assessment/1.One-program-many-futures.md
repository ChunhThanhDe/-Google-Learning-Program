### Feedback on IT Program

One of my favorite parts of the program was showing me how many different jobs have an IT department or use some aspect of IT. You can do pretty much anything, it's very motivating. The feeling of growth is an amazing thing, having felt stagnant for so long, working at what I had considered to be dead-end jobs, with no real vertical movement, and knowing that now you can advance, you can put yourself into so much more. 

ðŸ’¡ **Insight:** The program opened my eyes to the vast possibilities and expansion that IT offers. It's not just limited to what I initially thought IT was. 

The program was great for me. It gave me more understanding of what IT is and all the different opportunities you can get into. I can go into hardware, I can go into cybersecurity, and that's the best part because it's not just keeping me grounded to one level. I am able to go further.

ðŸ”‘ **Advantage:** This program is the way to go to get your foot in the door, to learn and do more in this field that you're interested in. It has the basic fundamentals, it gives you the building blocks, and from there, the sky is the limit.

âœ¨ **Endorsement:** Overall, I highly recommend this program for anyone looking to explore the diverse and expanding world of IT. It provides valuable insights and opportunities for personal and professional growth.
