# Quiz: Networking Fundamentals

## Question 1
🔢 **What factors limit the number of available IPv4 addresses?** (select all that apply)

- [x] The number of devices that connect to the Internet ✔️
- [ ] How many people are downloading something at the same time
- [x] The number of public and private websites in existence ✔️
- [ ] The number of IPv6 addresses in use

## Question 2
🔢 **Which of the following protocols is the primary infrastructure that creates the Internet?**

- [ ] TCP/IP
- [ ] DNS
- [ ] NAT
- [x] HTML ✔️

The TCP/IP protocol allowed computers to share information outside their network, contributing to the creation of the Internet as we know it today.

## Question 3
🔢 **What is the limitation of the IPv4 protocol?**

- [ ] Does not have any limitations.
- [ ] It's a slow protocol.
- [ ] It's obsolete.
- [x] Its maximum number of IP addresses has been reached. ✔️

The IPv4 protocol has reached the maximum number of IP addresses available for assignment.

## Question 4
🔢 **What invention allows people to share more information than just text on the Internet?**

- [ ] TCP/IP
- [ ] IPv4
- [x] The World Wide Web ✔️
- [ ] NAT

In the 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, which utilized different protocols for displaying information in web pages and became the predominant way of communication for accessing the Internet.

## Question 5
🔢 **How have the IPv4 limitations been solved?** (select all that apply)

- [x] By using Network Address Translation ✔️
- [ ] By using DNS
- [ ] By creating more IPv4 addresses
- [x] By implementing the IPv6 protocol ✔️

NAT allows organizations to use one public IP address and multiple private IP addresses within the network, conserving IPv4 addresses. The adoption of the IPv6 protocol, which provides a larger address space, has also helped solve the limitations of IPv4.
