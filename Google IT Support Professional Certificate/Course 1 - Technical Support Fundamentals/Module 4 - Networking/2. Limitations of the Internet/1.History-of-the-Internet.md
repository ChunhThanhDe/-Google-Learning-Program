# The Internet: Its Creation and Evolution üåê

## Introduction and Background üìö

Before diving into the history and significance of the Internet, let me introduce myself. I'm Gian Picasa, a Program Manager in Android Security. My role involves managing new security features for each version of Android, which helps protect its two billion plus users. I've been passionate about technology since a young age, working in IT from the age of 16. Throughout university, I spent my free time reading about new tech and building servers from old computer parts in my basement. I have fond memories of late-night browsing sessions on dial-up Internet, quietly exploring websites and absorbing random tech knowledge.

## Early IT Journey and Non-Profit Work üñ•Ô∏è

My first jobs were as a one-person IT crew at three non-profit organizations. It was both stressful and exciting to be responsible for everything, from configuring and administering backup servers to providing guidance on email access and computer usage for new employees. Despite not being a great test taker, I believed that hard work and perseverance would pave the way for a successful IT career. I'm thrilled to share my experiences with you and help you embark on your own IT journey.

## Importance of the Internet üíª

The Internet has become an integral part of our lives, encompassing our bank accounts, entertainment, news, and education. It's crucial to understand why the Internet holds such significance, especially as some of its original designs have reached their limitations. As an IT support specialist, it's essential to comprehend the future of the Internet and the reasons behind its evolution.

## The Birth of the Internet üï∞Ô∏è

Let's journey back to the 1950s, where it all began. Computers were massive and bulky back then. If you were a programmer, interacting directly with these colossal machines would become tiresome, especially when multiple people wanted to use the only available computing resource. In the late 1960s, the US government initiated a project called DARPA, which led to the creation of the earliest version of the Internet known as ARPANET. This development allowed computer programmers to remotely access shared computing resources. However, there was still a significant hurdle to overcome‚Äînetworks couldn't communicate with each other.

## The TCP/IP Breakthrough üåê

In the 1970s, a critical breakthrough in computer networking occurred. Computer scientists Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Initially, only a handful of computers in universities, governments, and businesses adopted TCP/IP. However, over the span of 50 years, billions of computers have implemented this protocol, enabling global data transmission. TCP/IP became the foundation of the modern Internet, allowing people worldwide to send data to one another.

## The Birth of the World Wide Web üåç

While TCP/IP enabled data transfer, the information being exchanged was predominantly plain text and lacked centralization. In the 1990s, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the worldwide web. This invention utilized different protocols to display information in webpages and quickly became the primary method for communication and accessing the Internet. With an Internet connection, anyone could access the vast information source of the World Wide Web.

## The Internet Today and its Impact üì≤

30 years have passed since the creation of the World Wide Web. We have progressed from simple email messages and basic web pages to engaging in video chats, receiving instant news updates, and conducting online transactions within seconds. The Internet has transformed our lives, enabling us to order food, purchase books, cars, and even participate in online courses like this one. The Internet as we know it today is the result of the collective knowledge and engineering efforts of numerous brilliant scientists and organizations.
