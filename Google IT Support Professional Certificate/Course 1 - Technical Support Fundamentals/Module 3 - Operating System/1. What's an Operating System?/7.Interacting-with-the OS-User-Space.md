# Userspace and Interacting with the Operating System

🖥️ Now that we've covered the major responsibilities of the kernel, let's delve into the final major aspect of an operating system: **userspace**. Userspace refers to how humans interact with the operating system.

👥 When we interact with an operating system, we perform various functions such as creating files and folders, opening applications, and deleting items. There are two primary ways we can interact with our OS: through a **shell** or a **graphical user interface (GUI)**.

🐚 While some shells incorporate graphical user interfaces, we'll focus on a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** shell. Essentially, this means we'll be using text commands to interact with the system. On the other hand, a GUI provides a visual way to interact with the computer. We use a mouse to click, drag, and open folders, among other actions. With a GUI, we can see everything we do on the screen. You probably use a GUI every day without even realizing it. For example, when watching this video, you likely used a GUI by clicking icons and navigating menus to open your web browser and access the website.

🌈 GUIs are often recognizable and associated with specific devices or products. You can typically distinguish between a computer running Microsoft Windows and one running macOS based on the design of windows, menus, and icons. GUIs are also prevalent on mobile phones, tablets, ATM machines, and airport kiosks.

🐚 A **shell** is a program that interprets text commands and sends them to the operating system for execution. Before the advent of graphical interfaces, commands such as creating a file had to be typed out. While GUIs are widely used today, shells are still commonly employed, particularly by power users. Power users, who possess above-average computer skills, often rely on commands rather than GUIs. In the realm of Linux, it's especially important to have command knowledge, as many Linux machines accessed in IT support roles are typically managed remotely and lack a GUI.

🐚 There are various types of shells, each with different features and performance characteristics. It's akin to the diversity among different operating systems. For our purposes, we'll focus on the most common shell: **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell).

❓ You might wonder why you should learn both a GUI and a shell. Particularly in an IT support role, it is crucial to have command-line proficiency. Some tasks can only be completed through commands, and in advanced IT roles, managing thousands of machines would be inefficient if you had to rely on clicking buttons or dragging windows individually. Commands allow you to automate processes and execute them across multiple machines simultaneously.

🚀 Embrace the power of the shell and its command-line capabilities. It will significantly enhance your effectiveness in an IT support role and enable you to accomplish tasks efficiently.
