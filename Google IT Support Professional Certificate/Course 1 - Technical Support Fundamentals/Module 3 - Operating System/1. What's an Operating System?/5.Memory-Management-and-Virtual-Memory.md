# Memory Management and Virtual Memory

🖥️ Remember that when a process runs, it requires both **CPU time** and **memory**. As processes are executed, they need to occupy space in memory so that the computer can quickly read and load them.

💾 However, compared to hard disk drives, memory is available in smaller quantities. To overcome this limitation and provide more memory than we physically have, we utilize a concept called **virtual memory**.

🔀 Virtual memory is a combination of **hard drive space** and **RAM** that acts as if it were actual memory accessible to our processes.

📦 When a process is executed, the program's data is divided into chunks called **pages**. These pages are stored in virtual memory. If we want to access and execute these pages, they need to be transferred from virtual memory to physical memory or RAM.

❓ You might wonder why we don't store the entire program in RAM to facilitate faster execution. While it's possible for small programs, it would be wasteful for larger applications.

⏱️ Have you ever experienced a slight slowdown in a word processor when accessing an infrequently used menu? This happens because the computer needs to load the page for that menu from virtual memory into RAM. Since we don't utilize all the features of an application simultaneously, there's no need to load everything into memory at once.

📚 It's similar to cooking a recipe from a cookbook. You don't need to read the entire book just to follow one recipe. You only refer to the pages of the recipe you're currently using.

📁 When we store our virtual memory on the hard drive, the allocated space is referred to as **swap space**. In practical applications of disk partitioning, we designate specific space for swap.

🔧 The kernel takes care of all these memory management tasks for us. It manages the process of swapping pages of data between RAM and virtual memory. The kernel is like the hardworking coordinator handling memory operations efficiently.

👏 By reaching this point in the lessons, you've made great progress. Keep up the good work!
