# Boot Methods Best Practices

üí° **Introduction**

The most common way to boot a computer is to simply push the power button and allow the normal startup process to run. However, there are situations where the normal startup process fails or you want to boot the computer with a different operating system. In such cases, you have several options for booting your operating system. This reading covers the various methods you can use to boot a computer.

üîÄ **The Boot Process**

When your computer is powered on, the BIOS/UEFI (BIOS) runs a series of diagnostic tests to ensure the computer's proper functioning. The BIOS is a low-level software that initializes the computer's hardware. The boot order, configured in the BIOS, determines which device the computer searches for a small program called a "bootloader." Once the bootloader is found on a device, it is executed, initiating the loading process of the specific operating system setup.

üìÇ **Configuring Boot Options**

To set the boot order and choose a boot method, you need to enter the computer's BIOS and configure the boot options. The method of entering the BIOS varies depending on the computer and operating system.

- On Windows or Linux: Power on the system and look for an on-screen message indicating the function key to press for entering setup (e.g., "Press DEL to enter SETUP," "F2=SETUP," or "Press F12 to enter SETUP").
- On macOS: Press and hold the Option key at startup to access the Startup Manager, which scans the computer for bootable devices.

The BIOS screen will display a Boot Options menu where you can set your preferred boot method. The menu lists devices attached to the system where a bootloader program may be found, such as internal hard drives, USB drives, CD drives, network storage, or cloud storage. The order in which these devices are searched for the bootloader can be configured.

üî¢ **Boot Method Options**

Various boot methods can be listed in the BIOS boot options:

üìü **External Options**:
- USB drive: Booting from a USB drive loaded with the necessary resources.
- Optical Media: Booting from a DVD, CD, or Blu-ray disk inserted in the computer's optical drive.
- Solid State Boot Drive: Booting from a solid state drive (SSD) that does not have moving parts.
- External hot-swappable drive: Booting from an external hard drive that can be moved between computers without turning it off.
- Network boot: Booting an operating system directly from a local area network (LAN) without using a storage device. Requires Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) capability and network setup.

üåê **Internet-based Boot**:
- Remote access: Booting from an internet source using Remote Access Controller (IPMI) or similar technology.
- Wake on LAN (WoL): Booting the computer remotely using Wake on LAN capabilities.

üì• **Internal Options**:
- Disk partitions: Creating partitions on a computer's drive to run separate operating systems. Known as dual booting.

üí° **Key Takeaways**

- There are multiple ways to boot a computer, including partitioning the drive for dual booting.
- External boot methods include USB drives, optical media, solid state boot drives, external hot-swappable drives, network booting, and internet-based booting.
- The boot method selection during startup depends on the operating system used.
