# Understanding File Management in Operating Systems

ðŸ“‚ Imagine if you had to store a single file in a cabinet. That sounds so bad. What if instead of one file, you had to store 100,000? Can you see a problem here? Well, on our computers, we can easily store hundreds of thousands of files, if not more. Problem solved? Not quite. We have to be able to keep track of all these files. The kernel handles file storage and file systems on our machines. In this lesson, we're going to dig a little deeper into how it does that.

## Components of File Management

There are three main components to handling files: **file handlers**, **file data**, and **metadata**.

### File System

Let's start with the **file system**. When we have a brand new hard disk that we want to store data on, we need to erase and configure the disk so that the operating system can read and write data to it. This is important because it's how our operating system keeps track of files. We must know what kind of file system is used.

There are lots of file systems that are used for different purposes. Some file systems support the storage of large amounts of data, while others only support small amounts. They can operate at different speeds and have varying resiliency towards file corruption and other factors. We won't get into which file system is best; that's for you to decide. But major operating system manufacturers have their own unique file systems that they recommend.

For example, Windows primarily uses the **NTFS** (New Technology File System) as the major file system. It was introduced in the previous version of the Windows operating system, Windows NT, and includes many features like encryption, faster access speeds, security, and more. Microsoft is also developing another file system called **ReFS** (Resilient File System), but it isn't quite ready for consumer use yet.

For Linux, different distributions may use different file system types. A standard file system for Linux is **EXT4**, which is compatible with older EXT file systems. In general, different file system types don't always play nicely with each other, so you might not be able to easily move files across different file systems depending on the file system type. It's a good guideline to use the file system that your operating system recommends.

### File Data

Another important part of file management is the storage of the actual **file data**. When we write data to our hard drive, it is stored in the form of **data blocks**. The data doesn't always sit in one piece; it can be broken down into many pieces and written to different parts of the disk. This is known as block storage.

Storing data in blocks improves the speed of handling data because the data is not stored in one long piece and can be accessed more quickly. It also helps in utilizing storage space efficiently.

### Metadata

Lastly, we need to keep **metadata**, which contains information about our files. Metadata includes details such as who created the file, when it was last modified, who has access to it, and more. The file metadata tells us everything we need to know about our file, including its type.

In certain operating systems, a **file extension** is appended to the filename to indicate its type. For example, in the filename "cool_image.jpg," the ".jpg" extension indicates that it is an image file. You will come across different types of file extensions like this.

Understanding file systems, file data storage, and metadata is a valuable skill to have as an IT support specialist. It can be useful when you need to perform tasks like recovering data from damaged disks or exploring ways to boot from different operating systems, such as Windows and Linux, on the same computer.
