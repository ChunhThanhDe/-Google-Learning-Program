## 📄 Resume and Online Professional Presence

To land an interview for a job you want, make sure your resume and online professional presence are in order. This will help you stand out from the other applicants when you apply.

### 📝 Crafting an Effective Resume

Your resume is your first introduction to a new company. Make sure your resume is easy to read and clearly shows the recruiter or hiring manager that you're a strong fit for the job you're applying for.

- Use a standard resume template and be consistent with your formatting and structure.
- Avoid using lots of filler text and stick to your relevant qualifications.
- Proofread your resume and have someone else review it to ensure there are no grammar or spelling errors.

🔍 **Supplemental Reading:** There's a lot more to say about resumes, so I've included more material in the supplemental reading.

### 🖥️ Online Professional Presence

In addition to your resume, make sure you have an up-to-date online presence.

- Ensure your online profile looks professional and includes the most current resume, a professional photo, and updated contact information.
- Utilize professional networking platforms like LinkedIn to enhance your online presence.

## 📑 Understanding the Job Role

When you find a job that you want to apply for, take the time to learn as much as you can about the role.

- Start by thoroughly reading the job description, including the roles, responsibilities, and requirements.
- Understand the information provided about the company and assess if it aligns with your career goals and aspirations.
- Ask your recruiter any additional questions you have about the role or the company to gain further clarity.

## 📚 Researching the Company

Apart from understanding the job requirements, it's crucial to research the company you're applying to.

- Learn about the main characteristics of the company, its primary products or services, customer base, and locations.
- Look for new and exciting aspects of the company's future.
- Familiarize yourself with any challenges the company might be facing.
- Read the company's code of conduct or mission statement to understand their values and priorities.

## 📅 Preparing for the Interview

Once you have an interview scheduled, there are a few things to keep in mind to ensure you're well-prepared.

- Know the interview location and arrive on time.
- Research the appropriate attire for the interview and dress accordingly.

💡 **Anecdote:** When I first interviewed with Google, I had to navigate a temporary space above a restaurant in Ann Arbor, a town I was unfamiliar with. Despite the lack of clear signage, I managed to find the entrance with resourcefulness and determination, which made a lasting impression.

🤝 **Manager's Perspective:** To this day, my manager still talks about my entrance and says it showed him I was resourceful and determined. Who knows? Maybe that's why they decided to give me the job.
