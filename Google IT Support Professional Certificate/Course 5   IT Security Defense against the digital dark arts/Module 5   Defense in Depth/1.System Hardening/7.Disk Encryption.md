## Disk Encryption Guide üîê

### What is Full Disk Encryption (FDE)?

**Full Disk Encryption (FDE)** is a security measure that encrypts the entire hard drive of a system, making the data unreadable without proper authentication. It plays a crucial role in a defense-in-depth security model by protecting data from physical attacks and unauthorized access.

### Key Points of FDE

1. **Protection Against Data Theft**:
   - Encrypts the entire hard drive, making the data inaccessible without the correct encryption password or key.
   - Essential for mobile devices like laptops, cell phones, and tablets, as well as desktops and servers.

2. **Confidentiality and Integrity**:
   - **Confidentiality**: Protects sensitive information from being accessed if the device is lost or stolen.
   - **Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized tampering with system files even if an attacker has physical access to the device.

3. **Boot Process with FDE**:
   - **Critical Files**: For the system to boot, critical files like the kernel and bootloader must be accessible. These files are stored in an unencrypted partition.
   - **Secure Boot**: This protocol, part of UEFI specifications, uses public key cryptography to verify the integrity of boot files, preventing tampering.

### Popular FDE Solutions

1. **First-Party Solutions**:
   - **Microsoft BitLocker**: Available for Windows systems.
   - **Apple FileVault 2**: Available for macOS systems.

2. **Third-Party and Open Source Solutions**:
   - **Linux DM-Crypt**: A popular choice for Linux systems.
   - **PGP, TrueCrypt, FileCrypt**: Various other options available.

### Encryption Key Management

1. **Encryption Key**:
   - The secret key used for encryption and decryption operations.
   - Often password-protected to secure access.

2. **User Key**:
   - Derived from the encryption key and used to encrypt the master key.
   - Allows for changing the encryption key without decrypting and re-encrypting the entire disk.

3. **Key Escrow**:
   - Enterprise solutions often include key escrow functionality for password recovery.
   - Allows system administrators to retrieve a recovery key if a user forgets their passphrase.

### FDE vs. File-Based Encryption

1. **Full Disk Encryption (FDE)**:
   - Encrypts the entire disk, including system and user files.
   - Provides strong protection against physical attacks but requires entering the encryption password at boot time.

2. **File-Based Encryption**:
   - Encrypts specific files or folders rather than the entire disk.
   - Often used for home directory encryption.
   - More convenient but less protected against physical attacks, as system files are not encrypted.

### Considerations for Implementation

1. **Forgotten Passwords**:
   - **FDE**: If the encryption password is forgotten, the data becomes inaccessible. Key escrow can mitigate this risk.
   - **File-Based Encryption**: Generally does not have the same recovery risks since only selected files are encrypted.

2. **Security vs. Usability**:
   - **FDE**: Offers strong security but may impact usability, requiring authentication at boot time.
   - **File-Based Encryption**: More convenient for remote access but less secure against physical attacks.

### Conclusion

Disk encryption, whether full disk or file-based, is a vital component of a security strategy, especially for protecting data from physical threats. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach helps in designing a robust security architecture tailored to your organization‚Äôs needs.

Next, we‚Äôll explore application hardening, another critical aspect of security.
