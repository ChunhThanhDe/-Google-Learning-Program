### Hashing 🔍

#### **Introduction to Hashing** 🧩

- **Definition**: Hashing is a process that takes an arbitrary input and maps it to a fixed-size output, known as a hash or digest. 
- **Output Size**: The size of the hash is constant and specified in bits, regardless of the input size.
- **Uniqueness**: Ideally, each unique input should produce a unique hash. 

#### **Applications** 🛠️

- **Hash Tables**: Used in data structures to speed up data lookups.
- **Data Deduplication**: Identifies and removes duplicate datasets to save space.
- **Database Indexing**: Speeds up searches and data retrieval.

#### **Cryptographic Hash Functions** 🔒

- **Purpose**: Used for security-related tasks such as authentication, message integrity, fingerprinting, and digital signatures.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **One-Directional**: Impossible to reverse the function to recover the original input.
  - **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same hash.
  - **Efficient**: Quick to compute.
  - **Small Changes**: A small change in input results in a completely different hash output.
  - **Collision-Resistant**: Prevents two different inputs from producing the same output.

#### **Comparison with Symmetric Encryption** 🔐

- **Similarities**: Both operate on blocks of data. Many hash functions are based on modified block ciphers.
- **Differences**: Hashing is one-way and does not allow recovery of the original data, unlike encryption which is reversible with the right key.

#### **Example** 💡

- **Imaginary Hash Function**: 
  - Input: "Hello World"
  - Hash Output: E49AOOFF
  - Input: "hello world" (with slight modification)
  - Hash Output: FF1832AE

- **Real Hash Function Example**: 
  - Using `md5sum` on the input "Hello World" produces a consistent hash digest.

#### **Summary** 📜

- **Hashing** maps data to a fixed-size output, crucial for various computing applications.
- **Cryptographic Hash Functions** provide security features like non-reversibility and collision resistance.
