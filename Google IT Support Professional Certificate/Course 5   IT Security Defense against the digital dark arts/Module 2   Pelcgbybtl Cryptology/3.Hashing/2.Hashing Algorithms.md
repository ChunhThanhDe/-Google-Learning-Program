## Hashing Algorithms 🛠️

#### **MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5)** 📜

- **Introduction**: Developed in the early 1990s, MD5 generates a 128-bit hash digest from 512-bit blocks.
- **Issues**:
  - **Design Flaw**: Discovered in 1996, leading cryptographers to recommend SHA1 as a more secure alternative.
  - **Collision Vulnerability**: By 2004, it was found that MD5 was susceptible to hash collisions, allowing different inputs to produce the same hash.
  - **Exploitation**: In 2008, researchers demonstrated creating a fake SSL certificate using MD5 collisions, leading to serious security breaches like the Flame malware in 2012.
- **Recommendation**: By 2010, it was advised to stop using MD5 for cryptographic applications due to its vulnerabilities.

#### **SHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)** 🔐

- **Introduction**: Part of the Secure Hash Algorithm suite published by NSA in 1995. It generates a 160-bit hash digest from 512-bit blocks.
- **Usage**: Employed in various protocols like TLS/SSL, PGP/SSH, IPSec, and version control systems like Git.
- **Vulnerabilities**:
  - **Weaknesses**: Theoretical attacks were developed in the 2000s, with practical implications emerging in 2015. A full collision attack was estimated to be feasible with significant computing resources.
  - **Full Collision**: In 2017, researchers published the first full SHA1 collision, using substantial CPU and GPU resources equivalent to 6,500 years of a single CPU and 110 years of a single GPU.
- **Recommendation**: SHA1 should be replaced with SHA2 or SHA3 due to its vulnerabilities.

#### **Message Integrity Check (MIC) vs. Message Authentication Code (MAC)** 🔍

- **MIC (Message Integrity Check)**:
  - **Function**: A hash digest of a message ensuring that its contents remain unchanged during transit.
  - **Limitations**: Does not use secret keys, hence it does not authenticate the message. It is susceptible to tampering if an attacker can recompute the checksum.
  - **Use Case**: Protects against accidental corruption or loss, but not against intentional modifications.

- **MAC (Message Authentication Code)**:
  - **Function**: Provides both integrity and authentication by using a secret key. 

#### **Summary** 📜

- **MD5**: Once popular but now obsolete for cryptographic purposes due to serious vulnerabilities and hash collisions.
- **SHA1**: Still used but vulnerable to collisions, and should be replaced by more secure algorithms like SHA2 or SHA3.
- **MIC**: Ensures data integrity but does not offer message authentication.

### Hashing Algorithms and Security Measures 🔐

#### **Authentication and Password Hashing** 🔑

- **Importance of Hashing**: 
  - **Why Hash Instead of Plain Text**: Storing passwords in plain text is insecure. If a system is compromised, attackers would gain access to all user passwords.
  - **Hashing Process**: Instead of storing passwords directly, systems store a hash of the password. During login, the entered password is hashed and compared to the stored hash. If they match, authentication is successful.

#### **Brute Force Attacks** 🛡️

- **Definition**: 
  - An attacker tries all possible input values to find a match for a hashed password.
  - **Computational Intensity**: Brute force attacks are time and resource-intensive. Theoretically, any system can be attacked with unlimited resources, so the goal is to make this process impractically difficult.

- **Mitigation**: 
  - **Hashing Iterations**: Increasing the number of times a password is hashed (e.g., thousands of times) makes brute force attacks more difficult and time-consuming.

#### **Rainbow Tables** 🌈

- **Definition**: 
  - A precomputed table of possible passwords and their corresponding hashes. 
  - **Purpose**: Speed up the process of cracking hashed passwords by looking up precomputed values instead of hashing each guess.

- **Protection Against Rainbow Tables**:
  - **Salting**: Adding a unique, random value (salt) to the password before hashing.
    - **How It Works**: 
      - A random salt is concatenated with the password and hashed together.
      - The salt is stored along with the hash, making each password hash unique.
    - **Impact**: Attackers would need to generate a separate rainbow table for each possible salt value, making it computationally and storage-wise impractical.

- **Salt Size**:
  - **Early Systems**: Used 12-bit salts (about 4,096 possible values).
  - **Modern Systems**: Use 128-bit salts (over 340 undecillion possible values), raising the difficulty to infeasible levels.

#### **Summary** 📜

- **Hashing**: Essential for secure password storage. Avoids storing sensitive data in plain text.
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Difficult to prevent entirely but can be mitigated by increasing the number of hashing iterations.
- **Rainbow Tables**: Precomputed tables of hashes can be defeated by using salts, which make each password hash unique and harder to crack.
