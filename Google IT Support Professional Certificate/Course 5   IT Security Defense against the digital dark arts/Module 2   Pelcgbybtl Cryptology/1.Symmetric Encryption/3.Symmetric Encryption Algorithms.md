## Symmetric Encryption Algorithms üîê

Symmetric encryption algorithms use a single key for both encryption and decryption. This summary covers the evolution of symmetric encryption, focusing on notable algorithms and their key features.

#### **Overview of Symmetric Encryption Algorithms** üîç

- **Definition**: Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for encrypting and decrypting data.
- **Key Size**: The strength of symmetric encryption largely depends on key length. Longer keys generally offer more security.

#### **Historical Context** üìú

- **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**:
  - **Introduction**: Developed in the 1970s by IBM with input from the US NSA.
  - **Specifications**: 
    - Block size: 64 bits
    - Key size: 56 bits (64 bits total, with 8 bits used for parity checking)
  - **Security**: Initially robust, but key length proved insufficient as technology advanced. In 1998, DES was broken in 56 hours by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) due to its small key size.

- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**:
  - **Introduction**: Adopted in 2001 by NIST to replace DES after an international competition.
  - **Specifications**: 
    - Block size: 128 bits
    - Key sizes: 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits
  - **Security**: AES is highly secure with current technology, and brute-force attacks are impractical due to its large key sizes.

#### **Algorithm Implementation** üíª

- **Speed and Ease of Implementation**: 
  - **Implementation**: Efficient algorithms are preferred to avoid errors and maintain security. Speed is crucial for handling frequent encryption operations.
  - **Hardware Acceleration**: Modern CPUs from Intel and AMD include AES instructions to speed up encryption and decryption processes.

#### **Stream Ciphers** üîÑ

- **RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)**:
  - **Introduction**: Widely used due to its simplicity and speed but has significant vulnerabilities.
  - **Weaknesses**: Vulnerable to attacks such as the RC4 no more attack, which can break encrypted connections. RC4 was deprecated in 2015 due to inherent weaknesses.

#### **Current Best Practices** ‚úÖ

- **Preferred Configuration**: 
  - **TLS 1.2 with AES-GCM**: TLS 1.2 with AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) is a preferred secure configuration. GCM turns AES into a stream cipher, using randomized seed values and sequentially numbered blocks of ciphertext to ensure robust encryption.

### Key Takeaways

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, with key size impacting security.
- **DES**: An older standard with limited key size, now replaced by AES.
- **AES**: Modern standard with strong security features and larger key sizes.
- **RC4**: Previously popular but now considered weak and deprecated.
- **Current Practice**: Use AES-GCM with TLS 1.2 for secure encryption.
