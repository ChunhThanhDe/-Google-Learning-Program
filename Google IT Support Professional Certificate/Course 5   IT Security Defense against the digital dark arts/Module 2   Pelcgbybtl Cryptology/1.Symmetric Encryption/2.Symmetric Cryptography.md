## Symmetric Cryptography 🔐

Symmetric cryptography involves using the same key for both encryption and decryption processes. This section explores symmetric key algorithms, their mechanisms, and different types of ciphers.

#### **Overview of Symmetric Cryptography** 📜

- **Definition**: Symmetric cryptography uses a single key for both encrypting and decrypting messages. The key must remain private to ensure security.
- **Key Component**: The key is crucial and must be kept confidential to prevent unauthorized decryption.

#### **Substitution Ciphers** 🔄

- **Definition**: A substitution cipher replaces parts of plaintext with ciphertext based on a predefined mapping.
- **Example**: 
  - **Caesar Cipher**: Shifts the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D'.
  - **ROT13**: A specific type of Caesar cipher with a shift of 13. Applying ROT13 twice returns the original plaintext.

  **Example Encoding**:
  - **Plaintext**: "Hello World"
  - **Ciphertext (ROT13)**: "URYYB JBEYQ"

  ROT13 is its own inverse, meaning encoding and decoding use the same process.

#### **Types of Symmetric Ciphers** 🔐

1. **Stream Ciphers** 🎞️
   - **Operation**: Encrypts data one character or digit at a time.
   - **Characteristics**: Fast and less complex but can be less secure if key management is poor.

2. **Block Ciphers** 🧩
   - **Operation**: Encrypts data in fixed-size blocks. If the data doesn’t fill the block, it is padded.
   - **Characteristics**: Generally more secure but can be slower and more complex to implement.

#### **Key Management** 🔑

- **Initialization Vector (IV)**:
  - **Purpose**: Prevents key reuse by introducing randomness.
  - **Usage**: A random IV is combined with the encryption key to create a unique key for each encryption session. The IV is sent in plaintext alongside the encrypted data.

- **Example**: In wireless encryption (e.g., 802.11), the IV is included in the plaintext before the encrypted data payload.

### Key Takeaways

- **Symmetric Key Algorithms**: Use the same key for encryption and decryption.
- **Substitution Ciphers**: Include techniques like Caesar Cipher and ROT13, which involve replacing characters based on a key.
- **Stream vs. Block Ciphers**: Stream ciphers process data one unit at a time, while block ciphers process fixed-size blocks.
- **Key Management**: Essential to avoid key reuse, achieved using Initialization Vectors (IVs).
