#### **Real-World Application** 🌍

- **Example Scenario**: 
  - If discussing sensitive information, encryption ensures that even if a malicious person is present, they cannot eavesdrop on the conversation.
  - Choosing secure communication methods over basic ones (e.g., avoiding TelNet) for enhanced security.

#### **Summary** 📈

- **Role**: Protecting and managing access to systems and data.
- **Focus Areas**: Access control, monitoring, remote management, and secure communication.
