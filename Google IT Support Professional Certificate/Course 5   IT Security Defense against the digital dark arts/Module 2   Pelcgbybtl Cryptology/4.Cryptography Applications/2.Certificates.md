### Certificates and Trust Models 🔑🔍

#### **X.509 Standard** 📜

- **Overview**:
  - Defines the format of digital certificates.
  - First issued in 1988, with Version 3 being the current standard.
  - Includes specifications for a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) to manage invalid certificates.

- **Fields in an X.509 Certificate**:
  - **Version**: Indicates the X.509 standard version used.
  - **Serial Number**: A unique identifier for the certificate assigned by the Certificate Authority (CA).
  - **Signature Algorithm**: Specifies the public key and hashing algorithms used to sign the certificate.
  - **Issuer Name**: Details the authority that issued the certificate.
  - **Validity**: Contains two subfields:
    - **Not Before**: Start date of certificate validity.
    - **Not After**: End date of certificate validity.
  - **Subject**: Information about the entity to which the certificate was issued.
  - **Subject Public Key Info**: Details the public key algorithm and the public key itself.
  - **Certificate Signature Algorithm**: Must match the algorithm used in the Subject Public Key Info.
  - **Certificate Signature Value**: The digital signature data of the certificate.

- **Certificate Fingerprints**:
  - Hash digests of the entire certificate, used for validation and inspection.

#### **Web of Trust** 🌐🔗

- **Concept**:
  - An alternative to the centralized PKI model.
  - Individuals sign each other's public keys rather than relying on a CA.
  - Involves verifying identities through agreed-upon methods (e.g., ID checks) before signing keys.

- **Process**:
  - **Key Signing Parties**: Events where participants verify and sign each other's keys.
  - **Reciprocal Trust**: Each party signs the public key of the other, establishing mutual trust.
  - **Web Expansion**: As new members are introduced and trusted, they extend the web of trust, linking separate trust networks.

#### **Summary** 📈

- X.509 certificates provide a structured format for managing digital identities and secure communications.
- The web of trust offers a decentralized approach to establishing trust and verifying identities without relying on centralized authorities.
