### Cryptography in Action 🔒💻

#### **HTTPS and TLS** 🌐🔐

- **HTTPS**:
  - Secure version of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
  - Utilizes SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt HTTP traffic.
  - Ensures encrypted communication over the internet, protecting data from eavesdroppers, verifying both parties, and maintaining data integrity.

- **TLS**:
  - A protocol for secure communications beyond just web browsing (e.g., VoIP calls, email, instant messaging, Wi-Fi security).
  - **Functions**:
    1. **Secure Communication**: Protects data from potential eavesdroppers.
    2. **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of communicating parties (typically the server to the client).
    3. **Integrity**: Ensures messages are not lost or altered in transit.

- **TLS Handshake**:
  - **ClientHello**: Client initiates connection with supported TLS version and cipher suites.
  - **ServerHello**: Server responds with selected protocol version and cipher suite, transmits its digital certificate.
  - **Certificate Validation**: Client checks the server's certificate for validity and hostname.
  - **ClientKeyExchange**: Establishes a shared secret for symmetric encryption.
  - **ChangeCipherSpec**: Signals the switch to secure communication.
  - **Finished Messages**: Verifies successful completion of the handshake and secure channel establishment.

- **Forward Secrecy**:
  - Ensures session keys remain secure even if private keys are compromised.

#### **SSH (Secure Shell)** 🔐🖥️

- **Overview**:
  - Secure network protocol for accessing network services over unsecured networks.
  - Commonly used for remote command-line login.
  - Replaces unsecured protocols like Telnet, rlogin, and rexec.

- **Features**:
  - Uses public key cryptography for remote machine authentication.
  - Supports various key exchange mechanisms and symmetric encryption ciphers.
  - Can tunnel arbitrary network ports and traffic over the encrypted channel.

- **Public Key Authentication**:
  - User generates a key pair, distributing the public key to systems for authentication.
  - SSH verifies the public key against the private key, which remains secure with the user.

#### **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)** 📧🔐

- **Overview**:
  - An encryption application for authenticating data and ensuring privacy.
  - Commonly used for encrypted email, disk encryption, and file protection.
  - Developed by Phil Zimmermann in 1991 as a tool for secure communications among activists.

- **Historical Context**:
  - Faced legal challenges due to U.S. export restrictions on encryption technology.
  - Zimmermann creatively challenged restrictions by publishing the source code in a printed book, protected by the First Amendment.
  - Investigation closed in 1996 without charges.

- **Security**:
  - Highly secure, comparable to military-grade encryption.
  - Historically used RSA algorithm, later replaced by DSA to avoid licensing issues.
