### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 🌐🔒

#### **Overview of PKI** 🛡️

- **Definition**: 
  - PKI is a framework for managing digital certificates and public-key encryption, crucial for securing communications on the Internet.
  - **Components**: PKI involves the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates.

#### **Digital Certificates** 📜

- **Purpose**:
  - A digital certificate verifies that an entity owns a particular public key.
  - **Contents**:
    - Public key
    - Entity information
    - Digital signature from a Certificate Authority (CA) confirming the validity.

- **Trust Model**:
  - If the certificate's signature is valid and trusted, the public key can be used for secure communication.

#### **Certificate Authority (CA) & Registration Authority (RA)** 🏛️

- **CA**: 
  - Responsible for issuing and signing certificates.
  - Ensures the integrity and authenticity of certificates.

- **RA**:
  - Verifies the identities of entities requesting certificates.
  - Often combined with CA roles for simplicity.

#### **Certificate Types** 🔐

- **SSL/TLS Server Certificate**:
  - Used to establish secure connections between a web server and client (e.g., web browsers).
  - Ensures that the client can trust the server's identity.
  - **Wildcard Certificates**: Valid for multiple hostnames within a domain.
  - **Self-Signed Certificates**: Signed by the same entity that issues them, less trusted without prior endorsement.

- **SSL/TLS Client Certificate**:
  - Used to authenticate the client to the server.
  - Typically issued by an internal CA, not a public one.

- **Code Signing Certificates**:
  - Used to sign executable programs to verify their integrity and origin.
  - Helps users ensure that applications are not tampered with and come from the legitimate author.

#### **Chain of Trust** 🔗

- **Root Certificate Authority**:
  - The starting point of the trust chain.
  - Self-signed because no higher authority can validate them.
  - Signs other certificates and creates a hierarchical structure.

- **Intermediate CAs**:
  - Subordinate to the root CA.
  - Can sign additional certificates and extend the chain of trust.

- **End-Entity (Leaf) Certificates**:
  - Issued to end-users or applications.
  - Represents the final point in the certificate hierarchy without additional signing authority.

#### **Trust Distribution** 🌍

- **Root CA Distribution**:
  - Trust in root CAs is established through pre-installed root certificates in operating systems and browsers.
  - Major OS vendors and browsers distribute and manage these certificates to bootstrap the chain of trust.
