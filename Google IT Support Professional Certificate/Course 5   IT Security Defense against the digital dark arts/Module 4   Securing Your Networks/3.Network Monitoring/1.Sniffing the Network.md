# Sniffing the Network

Packet sniffing is a fundamental technique for monitoring and analyzing network traffic. It involves capturing network packets to understand and troubleshoot network behaviors.

### üì° **What is Packet Sniffing?**
- **Packet Sniffing**: The process of intercepting and capturing network packets in their entirety for analysis.
- **Purpose**: Useful for IT support specialists to troubleshoot network issues and monitor traffic.

### üîç **Basic Concepts**
1. **Default Network Interface Behavior**:
   - **Normal Operation**: Network interfaces usually accept and process packets addressed specifically to their MAC address.
   - **Packets with Other Addresses**: Typically dropped and not processed.

2. **Promiscuous Mode**:
   - **Function**: A special mode for network interfaces that allows them to capture all packets on the network segment, not just those addressed to them.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for network analysis and monitoring.
   - **Requirements**: Admin or root privileges are needed to enable promiscuous mode.

### üåê **Network Topology Considerations**
1. **Switches**:
   - **Challenge**: In a switch-based network, you can only capture traffic destined for or originating from your host.
   - **Solution**: To capture all traffic, place your machine between the switch's uplink port and the upstream device.
   - **Alternative**: Use **port mirroring** to duplicate traffic from a specific port or VLAN to a monitoring port on the switch.

2. **Hubs**:
   - **Function**: Connect a hub to monitor all traffic between devices connected to it.
   - **Drawbacks**: Reduced throughput and increased potential for collisions.

### üì∂ **Wireless Packet Capture**
1. **Promiscuous Mode on Wireless Networks**:
   - **Function**: Allows capturing of packets intended for other clients on the same network.
   - **Limitation**: Does not capture all wireless traffic in the vicinity.

2. **Monitor Mode**:
   - **Function**: Allows scanning across channels to capture all wireless traffic, regardless of the intended network.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for capturing traffic from all APs and clients in the area.
   - **Requirement**: The wireless interface must be in monitor mode, which can be enabled with specific tools or commands.

### üîß **Tools and Utilities**
- **Wireless Packet Capture Tools**: Examples include **aircrack-ng** and **Kismet**.
- **Encrypted Wireless Networks**: Packets can be captured but not decoded without knowing the encryption password.
