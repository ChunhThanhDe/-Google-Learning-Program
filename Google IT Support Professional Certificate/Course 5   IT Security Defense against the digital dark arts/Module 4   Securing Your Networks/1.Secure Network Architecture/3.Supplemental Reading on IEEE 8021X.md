## IEEE 802.1X: Port-Based Network Access Control üåêüîí

### Overview
IEEE 802.1X is a standard developed by the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)** that specifies a framework for **port-based network access control**. It governs how devices authenticate themselves before gaining access to Local Area Networks (LANs) or wireless networks, ensuring the integrity and security of the network.

### Key Components of IEEE 802.1X Authentication
The **authentication process** under IEEE 802.1X involves three key elements:

1. **Supplicant**: The client device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) that requests access to the LAN or wireless network.
2. **Authenticator**: The device that acts as a gatekeeper (e.g., a switch or wireless access point). It forwards the client's authentication request to the authentication server and blocks all non-authenticated traffic.
3. **Authentication Server**: The system (typically a **RADIUS server**) that verifies the credentials or identity of the supplicant. It decides whether the client is granted or denied access.

### Authentication Workflow üîÑ
1. **Initial Connection**: The supplicant sends an authentication request to the authenticator.
2. **Forwarding**: The authenticator relays this request to the authentication server.
3. **Verification**: The authentication server checks the credentials against its database.
   - **Valid Credentials**: If the credentials are valid, the authentication server grants access and the connection process begins.
   - **Invalid Credentials**: If the credentials are invalid, the server sends an **Access Reject** message, terminating the connection request.

### Authentication Methods üõ°Ô∏è

1. **Shared Key System**: A pre-configured key or passphrase is manually set on both the supplicant (client) and the network device (e.g., access point).
2. **Open System**: The server checks the supplicant‚Äôs credentials against a list of authorized devices. Typically, this is based on the **MAC address**, but it can vary by network configuration.

### Common Shared Key Authentication Methods üîë

1. **Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)**: A legacy authentication method that is no longer recommended due to vulnerabilities. Attackers can easily capture and crack the encryption.
2. **Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)**: Enhances network security by enforcing **IEEE 802.1X authentication** and key exchange with dynamic encryption keys. WPA is more secure than WEP.
3. **Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)**: An improvement upon WPA, offering stronger security. Both the supplicant and network device must use the same **WPA version** and **pre-shared key (PSK)**.

### Association Process ü§ù
Once authentication is complete, the **access point** or **router** records each mobile device, ensuring that data is routed correctly. This step is crucial for data delivery after successful authentication.

### **Key Takeaways** üìå
- **IEEE 802.1X** standardizes port-based network access control, using modern authentication methods.
- The authentication process involves three components: the **supplicant**, **authenticator**, and **authentication server**.
- Networks can use either a **shared key system** or an **open system** to control access.
- Upon successful authentication, the **connection** is established; otherwise, the request is rejected.

These methods ensure network security by controlling which devices are allowed to access the network.
