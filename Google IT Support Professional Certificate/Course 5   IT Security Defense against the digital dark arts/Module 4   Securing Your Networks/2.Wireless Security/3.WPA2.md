# WPA2: Advanced Security Protocol for Wi-Fi Networks

WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) enhances Wi-Fi security, providing a more robust solution than its predecessor, WPA, by utilizing **CCMP (Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol)**. This replaces the insecure RC4 cipher with **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**, significantly improving confidentiality and integrity.

## ðŸ”‘ **Key Security Features of WPA2:**
1. **CCMP with AES**: 
   - **Authenticated Encryption**: Ensures both confidentiality and integrity of data.
   - **AES in Counter Mode**: Uses a random seed and an incremental counter to create a stream cipher for encrypting data.
   - **CBC-MAC**: Authenticates messages by generating a digest before encryption.

2. **Four-Way Handshake Process**: 
   - WPA2 uses this handshake to authenticate clients and generate a unique encryption key for secure communication.
   - It derives the **Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)**, ensuring encryption confidentiality between the client and access point (AP).
   - The handshake also provides the **Group Transient Key (GTK)** for encrypting multicast or broadcast traffic, shared among all clients.

## ðŸ›  **How the Four-Way Handshake Works**:
1. **AP Sends ANonce**: The AP sends a random value (ANonce) to the client.
2. **Client Sends SNonce**: The client responds with its own random value (SNonce).
3. **AP Sends GTK**: The AP transmits the GTK encrypted with the PTK.
4. **Client Acknowledges**: The client confirms the successful key negotiation.

**PTK Generation**: Combines the Pairwise Master Key (PMK), nonces, and MAC addresses of both the AP and client. The PTK comprises several keys used for:
- Encrypting EAPoL packets.
- Sending/receiving message integrity codes.
- Temporarily encrypting data traffic.

**GTK**: Used to encrypt group communication, shared by all clients connected to the AP.

## ðŸ›¡ **WPA2-Enterprise vs. WPA2-Personal**:
- **WPA2-Personal (PSK)**: Uses a pre-shared key (password) to authenticate clients.
- **WPA2-Enterprise (802.1X)**: Introduces centralized authentication using a RADIUS server and dynamically generates PMKs.

## ðŸ’¥ **Vulnerability in WPA2: Brute-Force Attack on the Four-Way Handshake**:
WPA2 is robust but susceptible to offline **brute-force attacks** if an attacker captures the four-way handshake. Here's how:
1. **Capture Handshake Packets**: An attacker intercepts four packets exchanged during the handshake.
2. **Brute-Force PMK**: The attacker guesses the **PMK (Pairwise Master Key)**, combining the guessed password with the SSID.
3. **PTK Validation**: By verifying the message integrity (MIC), the attacker knows when theyâ€™ve guessed the correct PMK.
4. **Dictionary and Rainbow Table Attacks**: Using pre-computed **rainbow tables** (available for popular SSIDs and passwords), attackers can significantly reduce computational time by pre-calculating PMKs.

## ðŸ”„ **Mitigating Brute-Force Attacks**:
- **Strong Passwords**: Ensure WPA2 passphrases are long and complex to thwart dictionary and rainbow table attacks.
- **Regular Key Rotation**: Periodically update network keys (GTK and PMK) to limit the attack window.
