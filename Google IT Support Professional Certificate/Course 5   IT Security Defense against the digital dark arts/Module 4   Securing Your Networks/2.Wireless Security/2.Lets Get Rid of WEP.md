# Summary of WPA and WPS Security in Wireless Networks

## **WPA: Wi-Fi Protected Access**
WPA was introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance as a temporary solution to replace WEP without requiring new hardware. It introduced stronger security mechanisms, most notably **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)**, which made it more secure than WEP.

### **Key Features of WPA with TKIP:**
1. **Improved Key Derivation**: TKIP incorporates the initialization vector (IV) into the packet encryption key more securely, preventing key reuse.
2. **Sequence Counter**: Protects against **replay attacks** by rejecting packets that arrive out of order.
3. **64-bit Message Integrity Check (MIC)**: Detects packet tampering, preventing forgery or corruption.

Although WPA still used the RC4 cipher, TKIP enhanced the way keys were generated:
- **Key Mixing Function**: Generated unique encryption keys for each packet, using a 256-bit key.
- The **Wi-Fi passphrase** (pre-shared key) is not directly used to encrypt traffic but serves as a factor in deriving the encryption key using **PBKDF2** with the **SSID** as a salt.

#### **Brute-Force Resistance**:
- WPA increases the computational difficulty of brute-force attacks by running the pre-shared key through **HMAC-SHA1** **4,096 times**, making it harder for attackers to crack the passphrase.

## **WPS: Wi-Fi Protected Setup**
Introduced in 2006, WPS makes it easier for users to connect to Wi-Fi networks securely without directly entering the passphrase. It provides multiple methods for clients to join the network:

### **WPS Methods**:
- **PIN Entry**: Vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to weak PIN structure.
- **NFC or USB**: Used for out-of-band transmission of network details.
- **Push Button Authentication**: Requires pressing a button on both the **AP** (Access Point) and client side.

#### **WPS Vulnerabilities**:
- The **PIN Entry Method** is particularly weak:
  - Uses an 8-digit PIN, but only **7 digits** are used for verification, making the maximum possibilities **10^7** (10 million).
  - The PIN is verified in two halves, reducing the number of possible combinations to **11,000** (10,000 for the first half, and 1,000 for the second half).
  - Without rate limiting, this attack can reveal the PIN and pre-shared key in **less than 4 hours**.
  
#### **Mitigation**:
- The Wi-Fi Alliance introduced a **lockout period** after three incorrect PIN attempts, increasing the time to crack the PIN from **4 hours to 3 days**. However, determined attackers could still brute-force the PIN within that time frame.

### **Impact of WPS Breaches**:
- **Reusing the PIN**: Even if the Wi-Fi password is changed, the compromised WPS PIN can still be reused to gain access, making the attack persistent unless WPS is disabled.
