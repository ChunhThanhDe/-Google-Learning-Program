# Wireless Hardening: Enhancing Wi-Fi Security

Wireless hardening is crucial for securing networks against attacks. Several strategies can be implemented to maximize the security of wireless networks, striking a balance between protection and management complexity.

## üîê **Best Option: 802.1X with EAP-TLS**
- **EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Transport Layer Security)**: Provides the highest level of wireless security by implementing **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**.
- **Components**: Requires a **RADIUS server**, **authentication back-end**, and client certificates signed by a trusted authority.
- **Complexity**: High overhead due to PKI deployment and certificate management, making it challenging for many organizations to implement.
  - **Client Certificates**: Must be distributed to all clients that authenticate to the network.
  - **Certificate Management**: Requires a system to sign and manage these certificates.

**Benefits**:
- Superior security if PKI is properly handled.
- Difficult for attackers to breach due to strong encryption and mutual authentication.

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Alternative: WPA2 with AES/CCMP**
For companies that find **802.1X** too complex, **WPA2 with AES/CCMP** is a strong alternative.

### Steps to Enhance Security in WPA2:
1. **Long, Complex Passphrases**: 
   - Prevent brute-force and rainbow table attacks by using a long passphrase that can't be found in a dictionary. 
   - Increases computational effort required for attacks.
   
2. **Unique SSID**: 
   - Avoid common SSIDs (e.g., "default" or "linksys") to minimize the risk of rainbow table attacks.
   - A unique SSID forces attackers to perform custom computations, which raises the attack difficulty.

## üö´ **Avoid Using WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)**
- **WPS**: Often enabled for consumer convenience, but it's a security vulnerability in enterprise environments.
- **Recommendation**: Disable WPS on your APs (Access Points) as it compromises network security.

### Additional Precautions:
- **Disable WPS in AP Management Console**: Ensure WPS is fully disabled in the settings.
- **Verify Using Tools Like Wash**: Sometimes, even if WPS is disabled in the console, it might remain active. Use external tools (e.g., **Wash**) to independently verify that WPS is indeed disabled.

---

By carefully selecting the right security mechanisms, either **EAP-TLS** for maximum protection or **WPA2 with AES/CCMP** for practicality, organizations can ensure robust wireless security. Disabling WPS and using complex passwords and unique SSIDs further strengthens defenses against potential attacks. üîí
