### Network Attacks: Overview of Common Threats 🌐🔒

Understanding various network attacks is crucial for maintaining cybersecurity. Here’s a detailed look at some common network attacks and their impacts:

#### 1. **DNS Cache Poisoning** 🧪🔄
   - **Definition**: An attack where fake DNS records are injected into a DNS server’s cache, causing it to resolve domain names to malicious IP addresses.
   - **Impact**: Users are redirected to compromised servers, which can host malicious software or steal sensitive information.
   - **Real-World Example**: In Brazil, attackers poisoned DNS caches of local ISPs, redirecting users to fake sites that installed a banking trojan designed to steal credentials.

#### 2. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack** 🕵️‍♂️🔍
   - **Definition**: An attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two hosts who believe they are communicating directly with each other.
   - **Types**:
     - **Session Hijacking**: An attacker steals a session token to impersonate a user on a website, gaining unauthorized access.
     - **Rogue Access Point**: An unauthorized wireless access point is set up within a network, allowing attackers to intercept network traffic.
     - **Evil Twin**: An attacker creates a network with the same name as a legitimate network to trick users into connecting to it. The attacker then monitors or intercepts the traffic.

#### **Key Points** ✔️
   - **DNS Cache Poisoning**: Redirects users to malicious sites by corrupting DNS records.
   - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Includes session hijacking, rogue access points, and Evil Twin attacks, all of which involve intercepting and possibly manipulating communications.
   - **Prevention**: Regularly update and monitor network security measures to prevent these attacks and ensure data integrity.

Understanding and defending against these attacks are essential for protecting network resources and sensitive information. 🛡️🔐
