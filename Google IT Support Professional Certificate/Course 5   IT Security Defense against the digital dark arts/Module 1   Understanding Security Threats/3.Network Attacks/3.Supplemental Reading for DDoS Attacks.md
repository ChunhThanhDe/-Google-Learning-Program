### Overview of High-Profile Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks 🌐🚫

DDoS attacks are coordinated attempts by cybercriminals to overwhelm a target's online resources, rendering them inaccessible to legitimate users. These attacks utilize a network of hijacked systems to flood the target with excessive traffic, impacting their availability. Here are notable examples of high-profile DDoS attacks:

#### 1. **2020 AWS Attack** 🚀🛡️
   - **Details**: The largest DDoS attack recorded, affecting AWS cloud servers with a peak traffic rate of 2.3 terabytes per second (Tbps) over three days. The attack was 44% larger than previous records and targeted an undisclosed AWS customer using CLDAP web servers.
   - **Technique**: CLDAP (Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) was used for amplification.

#### 2. **2018 GitHub Attack** 💻🔥
   - **Details**: GitHub faced a massive DDoS attack that sent 126.9 million packets per second, with a throughput of 1.3 Tbps. The attackers leveraged memcached servers for amplification.
   - **Technique**: Memcached amplification, magnifying the attack impact by a factor of ~50,000.

#### 3. **2017 Google Cloud Attack** 🌐⚡
   - **Details**: Google Cloud experienced a DDoS attack with a magnitude of 2.54 Tbps, targeting approximately 180,000 web servers.
   - **Technique**: Fake packets were used to overwhelm Google’s infrastructure. The attack was part of a series targeting Google.

#### 4. **2016 Dyn Attack** 🌍🔍
   - **Details**: Dyn’s DNS service was hit by a DDoS attack using Mirai malware, affecting major websites like Netflix, Amazon, and Reddit. The attack involved IoT devices turned into botnets.
   - **Technique**: IoT device botnets generating attack traffic through DNS queries.

#### 5. **2015 GitHub Attack** 🇨🇳🖥️
   - **Details**: A politically motivated attack from China targeted GitHub projects resisting censorship. The attack utilized Baidu’s analytics services to inject malicious JavaScript into user browsers.
   - **Technique**: JavaScript injection via Baidu to make repeated HTTP requests.

#### 6. **2013 Spamhaus Attack** 📧💥
   - **Details**: Spamhaus, a spam-filtering service, was hit with 300 Gbps of traffic. The attackers aimed to disrupt Spamhaus and its DDoS defense provider, Cloudflare. The attack caused significant harm to LINX, the London Internet Exchange.
   - **Technique**: High-volume traffic aimed at spam filtering services and Internet exchanges.
