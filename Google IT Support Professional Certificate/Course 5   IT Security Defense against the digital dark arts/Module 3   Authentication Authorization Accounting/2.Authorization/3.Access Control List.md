### Access Control List (ACL) 📜🔐

#### **Overview** 🌟

An Access Control List (ACL) is a method for defining and managing permissions or authorizations for various objects. ACLs are utilized both in file systems and network security to control access to resources.

#### **File System ACLs** 💻

- **Definition**: 
  - ACLs are tables or databases listing access rights for individuals or groups regarding different objects like folders, files, or programs.

- **Components**:
  - **Access Control Entries (ACEs)**: Individual entries in an ACL specifying permissions such as read, write, or execute for each object.

- **Purpose**:
  - **File Permissions**: Control user or group access to files and directories, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

#### **Network ACLs** 🌐

- **Definition**:
  - ACLs in network security apply access controls to network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls.

- **Components**:
  - **Incoming Traffic**: Rules to manage and restrict incoming network traffic.
  - **Outgoing Traffic**: Rules to control and limit outbound traffic.

- **Purpose**:
  - **Restrict External Access**: Limit external access to systems and services within the network.
  - **Enforce Policies**: Ensure compliance with organizational policies and prevent unauthorized data transfers.

#### **Key Takeaways** 📌

- **File System ACLs**: Manage file and folder access permissions through ACEs.
- **Network ACLs**: Regulate network traffic and control access to services within the network.

ACLs are essential for maintaining security and ensuring that only authorized individuals or systems have access to specific resources.
