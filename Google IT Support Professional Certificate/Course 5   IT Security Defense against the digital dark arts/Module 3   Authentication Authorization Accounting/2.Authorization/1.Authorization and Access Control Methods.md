### Authorization and Access Control Methods 🔐

#### **Overview** 🌟

Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is permitted to access. It is a distinct component from authentication, which focuses on verifying a user's identity. While authentication confirms "who you are," authorization determines "what you can do."

#### **Authentication vs. Authorization** 🆔➡️🔓

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of a user (e.g., through credentials like a username and password).
- **Authorization**: Defines what resources or services the authenticated user is allowed to access.

Even if a user successfully authenticates, they must be authorized to access specific resources or services. If the user lacks the necessary permissions, access will be denied.

#### **Kerberos and Authorization** 🎟️

- **Kerberos**: After successful authentication, users receive a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).
  - **Access Request**: To access a service, the user sends a request to the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) using the TGT.
  - **Authorization Check**: The TGS checks if the user is authorized to access the requested service. If authorized, the TGS returns a service ticket; otherwise, the request is denied.

#### **OAuth** 🔗

- **OAuth**: A widely used open standard for authorization and access delegation.
  - **Usage**: Commonly employed by major companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.
  - **Function**: Allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to a user’s resources without exposing credentials.

#### **Key Points** 📌

- **Authentication and Authorization**: While related, they serve different functions in the security framework.
- **Authorization Methods**: Ensure that authenticated users have the appropriate permissions to access specific resources.
- **OAuth**: Provides a standardized way to delegate access while maintaining security and privacy.

Understanding the distinction between authentication and authorization is crucial for implementing robust security measures and ensuring that users have appropriate access to resources.
