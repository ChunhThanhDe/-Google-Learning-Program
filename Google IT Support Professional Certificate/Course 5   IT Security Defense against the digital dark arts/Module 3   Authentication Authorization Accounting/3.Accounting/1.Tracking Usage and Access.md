### Tracking Usage and Access 📊🔍

#### **Overview** 🌟

Accounting, the final component of the AAA security framework, involves keeping detailed records of user interactions with resources and services. This includes tracking and auditing usage to ensure compliance and detect anomalies.

#### **Key Concepts** 🗝️

- **Accounting**: Involves logging and reviewing records of system usage, including what resources were accessed and what actions were performed.

- **Auditing**: The process of reviewing these records to identify and address any irregularities or unauthorized activities.

#### **Systems and Their Focus** 🖥️

- **TACACS+**:
  - **Focus**: User authentication and command execution during sessions.
  - **Details Tracked**:
    - Systems authenticated to.
    - Commands executed, especially in privileged modes.
    - Network services and system actions like configuration reloads or reboots.
  
- **RADIUS**:
  - **Focus**: Network access and session details.
  - **Details Tracked**:
    - Session duration.
    - Client location.
    - Bandwidth and resources used.
  
  - **Process**:
    - **Session Start**: Network access server sends an accounting request packet.
    - **Session Monitoring**: Periodic updates sent until an accounting stop packet is received.
    - **Response**: Accounting server acknowledges receipt of data.

  - **Uses**:
    - **Billing**: Track session length and data usage for ISP billing.
    - **Quotas**: Enforce data and time limits on sessions.

#### **Limitations** ⚠️

- **RADIUS Accounting**:
  - Does not record specific user activities, such as websites visited or protocols used.
  - Provides general statistics but lacks detailed action logs.

#### **Key Takeaways** 📌

- **Purpose of Accounting**: To monitor and audit user activity, ensuring that system usage aligns with security policies and detecting potential issues.
- **System-Specific Tracking**:
  - TACACS+ focuses on command-level details and device access.
  - RADIUS focuses on session details and network resource usage.

Implementing effective accounting and auditing practices is essential for maintaining system security and managing user activities.
