### RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) üåê

#### **Overview of RADIUS** üì°

RADIUS is a protocol that provides Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services for users on a network. It is widely used to manage access to internal networks, WiFi networks, email services, and VPN services.

- **History**: Originally designed for transporting authentication information for remote dial-up users, RADIUS has evolved to support various standard authentication protocols, including Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).

#### **Role of RADIUS in Authentication** üîê

- **Client Interaction**: Clients do not interact directly with the RADIUS server. Instead, they present their authentication credentials to a Network Access Server (NAS) or similar device.
- **Credential Relay**: The NAS relays these credentials to the RADIUS server for verification.
- **Authentication Scheme**: The RADIUS server verifies the credentials using a configured authentication scheme, which could involve flat files or external sources like SQL databases, LDAP, Kerberos, or Active Directory.

#### **RADIUS Authentication Process** ‚úÖ

1. **Credential Submission**: A client submits authentication credentials to the NAS.
2. **Relay to RADIUS**: The NAS forwards these credentials to the RADIUS server.
3. **Verification**: The RADIUS server checks the credentials against its authentication scheme.
4. **Response**: Based on the verification, the RADIUS server responds with one of the following messages:
   - **Access-Accept**: Credentials are valid; access is granted.
   - **Access-Reject**: Credentials are invalid; access is denied.
   - **Access-Challenge**: Further information or verification is required.

#### **Key Points for IT Support Specialists** üõ†Ô∏è

- **Understanding RADIUS**: Even if you're not configuring RADIUS servers directly, knowing how RADIUS works can help troubleshoot issues when clients authenticate against RADIUS backend servers.
- **Common Use Cases**: RADIUS is used for managing access to a variety of network services, making it essential knowledge for handling network security and user authentication issues.

### **Key Takeaways** üìå

1. **Protocol Function**: Provides AAA services for network access.
2. **Client Interaction**: Involves credential submission via NAS, not direct server interaction.
3. **Verification Sources**: Can use internal or external authentication sources.
4. **Server Responses**: Includes Access-Accept, Access-Reject, and Access-Challenge.

Understanding RADIUS helps in managing and troubleshooting network authentication effectively.
