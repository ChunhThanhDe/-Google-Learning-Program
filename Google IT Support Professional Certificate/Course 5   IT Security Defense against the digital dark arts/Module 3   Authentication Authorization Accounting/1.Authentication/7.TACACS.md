### TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus) üîê

#### **Overview** üåê

TACACS+ is an AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) protocol developed by Cisco and released as an open standard in 1993. It replaced the older TACACS protocol from 1984 and its extended version, XTACACS.

- **Original TACACS**: Developed for MILNET (the unclassified network for DARPA), which later evolved into NIPRNet.
- **XTACACS**: A proprietary Cisco extension of TACACS.
- **TACACS+**: Designed to address device administration, providing a comprehensive AAA solution primarily for network infrastructure devices.

#### **Key Features** ‚ú®

- **Authentication**: Validates the identity of users attempting to access network devices.
- **Authorization**: Determines the level of access or permissions granted to authenticated users.
- **Accounting**: Tracks and logs user activities for auditing and reporting purposes.

#### **Differences from RADIUS** üÜö

- **Focus**: TACACS+ is geared towards device administration, whereas RADIUS is mainly used for network access.
- **Authorization and Accounting**: TACACS+ offers more granular control and detailed accounting features compared to RADIUS.

#### **Applications** üíª

- **Network Infrastructure**: TACACS+ is predominantly used for managing authentication, authorization, and accounting for network devices.
- **Security**: Given that network infrastructure devices are high-value targets, TACACS+ provides a robust solution for securing these critical components.

#### **Key Takeaways** üìå

1. **Purpose**: TACACS+ is a Cisco-developed protocol for managing AAA services specifically for network devices.
2. **Differences**: It differs from RADIUS mainly in its focus on device management and detailed authorization/accounting.
3. **Implementation**: While it might not be encountered frequently in support roles, understanding TACACS+ is valuable for securing network infrastructure as organizations grow.

TACACS+ is essential for IT professionals working with network infrastructure, ensuring comprehensive control and security over network device management.
