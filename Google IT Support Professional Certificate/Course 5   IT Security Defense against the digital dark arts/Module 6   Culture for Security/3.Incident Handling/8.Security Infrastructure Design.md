## Security Infrastructure Design Document

### 1. Authentication System
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all user accounts, especially those with access to sensitive information. Use a combination of passwords and one-time codes sent via SMS or generated by an authentication app.
- **Centralized Authentication System:** Utilize a centralized authentication system such as LDAP or Active Directory to manage user credentials and enforce security policies.

### 2. External Website Security
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** Ensure all data transmitted between users and the website is encrypted using HTTPS to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to protect against common web-based attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Regularly update and configure the WAF to address new threats.

### 3. Internal Website Security
- **Access Controls:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure employees only have access to the information necessary for their roles.
- **Network Segmentation:** Use VLANs to segment the internal network, separating the internal website from other systems to minimize risk and isolate potential threats.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Deploy an IDS to monitor internal traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.

### 4. Remote Access Solution
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN):** Provide a secure VPN for remote access, ensuring that all communications between remote employees and internal systems are encrypted. Use strong VPN protocols like OpenVPN or IPsec.
- **Reverse Proxy Solution:** Implement a reverse proxy to manage and secure remote access to internal applications and services, providing an additional layer of security and load balancing.

### 5. Firewall and Basic Rules Recommendations
- **Default Deny Policy:** Apply a default deny rule to block all inbound and outbound traffic by default, only allowing necessary traffic.
- **Allow Traffic:** Permit web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) to the external website and allow internal traffic necessary for business operations. Configure specific rules for remote access traffic.
- **Firewall Services:** Use both Network Firewalls and Host-Based Firewalls to provide layered protection, with rules specific to network segmentation and access control.

### 6. Wireless Security
- **WPA3 Encryption:** Use WPA3 encryption for the office wireless network to ensure strong protection against unauthorized access and attacks.
- **Guest Network:** Set up a separate guest network with restricted access to internal resources. Use WPA3 and restrict access to only the internet.

### 7. VLAN Configuration Recommendations
- **Engineering VLAN:** Create a dedicated VLAN for engineering employees, isolating their network traffic from other departments.
- **Sales VLAN:** Set up a separate VLAN for sales personnel to segment traffic and enhance security.
- **Infrastructure VLAN:** Allocate a VLAN for infrastructure services such as servers and network devices.
- **Guest VLAN:** Implement a guest VLAN with strict access controls to limit interaction with internal systems and resources.
- **802.1X Authentication:** Enforce 802.1X authentication on network switches to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to the network.

### 8. Laptop Security Configuration
- **Full-Disk Encryption (FDE):** Ensure that all laptops use full-disk encryption to protect data in case of loss or theft.
- **Antivirus and Anti-Malware:** Install and maintain up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software on all laptops to protect against malicious software.
- **Application Whitelisting:** Implement application whitelisting to allow only approved applications to run on company devices, preventing unauthorized software execution.

### 9. Application Policy Recommendations
- **Application Whitelisting:** Only allow approved applications to run on company devices. Regularly review and update the list of approved applications to meet security standards.
- **Software Update Policy:** Implement a policy requiring regular software updates and patches to address vulnerabilities and improve security.

### 10. Security and Privacy Policy Recommendations
- **Data Privacy Policy:** Develop and implement policies governing the collection, storage, and handling of customer data to comply with regulations such as GDPR or CCPA.
- **Incident Response Plan:** Create and maintain an incident response plan to effectively address and manage security breaches.
- **Employee Training:** Provide mandatory security training for employees, covering topics such as password management, phishing prevention, and general security best practices.
- **Password Policy:** Require passwords to be at least 8 characters long, include special characters, and mandate periodic password changes (e.g., every 6 months).

### 11. Intrusion Detection or Prevention for Systems Containing Customer Data
- **Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS):** Deploy a NIPS to actively block suspicious activity targeting systems containing customer data.
- **Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS):** Implement a HIDS on systems with customer data to monitor and detect suspicious activities at the host level.
