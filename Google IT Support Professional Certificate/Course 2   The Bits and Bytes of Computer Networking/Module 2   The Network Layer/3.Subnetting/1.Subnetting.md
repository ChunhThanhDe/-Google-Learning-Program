## Subnetting

🔀 **Introduction**
In the most basic terms, subnetting involves dividing a large network into smaller subnetworks or subnets.

🔎 **Why Subnetting is Necessary**
Subnetting is necessary to efficiently manage and organize network resources. It allows for better control over network traffic, enhances security, and optimizes network performance.

🔒 **Subnet Masks and Extended Possibilities**
Subnet masks extend the capabilities of network and host IDs. They define the boundaries of each subnet and determine how IP addresses are assigned within the network.

🔄 **CIDR for Enhanced Flexibility**
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a technique that provides even more flexibility than traditional subnetting. It allows for the allocation of variable-sized address blocks, improving address space utilization.

💻🔢 **Binary Math and Subnetting**
Understanding basic binary math techniques is crucial for comprehending subnetting. It enables better comprehension of how subnets are created and how IP addresses are assigned within them.

❌ **Issues with Incorrect Subnetting**
Incorrect subnetting setups can lead to various network issues. As an IT support specialist, having a strong understanding of subnetting is essential for troubleshooting and resolving such problems.

🌐 **Address Classes and Network Breakdown**
Address classes are used to divide the global IP space into discrete networks. Core routers on the Internet route messages based on the network ID of the IP address to the gateway router responsible for that network.

🔀➡️ **Gateway Routers and Ingress/Egress**
Gateway routers serve as entry and exit points for specific networks. They direct incoming and outgoing network traffic, ensuring proper communication within the network.

🔄 **Limitations of a Single Class A Network**
A single Class A network can accommodate a vast number of individual IP addresses (16,777,216). However, connecting such a large number of devices to a single router is impractical.

🔀 **Subnetting to Divide Networks**
Subnetting allows for the division of a large network into multiple smaller subnets. Each subnet has its own gateway router, serving as the entry and exit point for that specific subnet.
