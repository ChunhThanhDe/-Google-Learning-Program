# IP Datagram: Structure and Fields

📋 **Introduction**
Just like all the data packets at the Ethernet layer have a specific name – Ethernet frames – packets at the network layer are referred to as IP datagrams under the IP protocol.

📋 **IP Datagram Structure**
An IP datagram consists of two primary sections: the header and the payload. The header contains a lot more data than an Ethernet frame header does and is highly structured with strictly defined fields.

📋 **Header Fields**
1. **Version Field** (4 bits): Indicates the version of the Internet Protocol being used. The most common version is IPv4, while IPv6 is also gaining widespread adoption.
2. **Header Length Field** (4 bits): Declares the length of the entire header. For IPv4, this is typically 20 bytes, the minimum length of an IP header.
3. **Service Type Field** (8 bits): Specifies details about quality of service (QoS) or QoS technologies.
4. **Total Length Field** (16 bits): Indicates the total length of the IP datagram, including the header and payload.
5. **Identification Field** (16 bits): Groups messages together and indicates the size of an individual datagram.
6. **Flag Field**: Indicates if a datagram is allowed to be fragmented or if it has already been fragmented.
7. **Fragmentation Offset Field**: Contains values used to reassemble fragmented packets at the receiving end.
8. **Time to Live (TTL) Field** (8 bits): Indicates the maximum number of router hops a datagram can traverse before being discarded.
9. **Protocol Field** (8 bits): Contains data about the transport layer protocol being used, such as TCP or UDP.
10. **Header Checksum Field**: A checksum of the contents of the entire IP datagram header, similar to the Ethernet checksum field.
11. **Source and Destination IP Address Fields**: 32-bit fields storing the source and destination IP addresses.
12. **IP Options Field**: Optional field used to set special characteristics for datagrams, primarily for testing purposes.
13. **Padding Field**: Series of zeroes used to ensure the header is the correct total size.

📋 **Encapsulation**
The IP datagram serves as the payload of an Ethernet frame, encapsulating its entire contents. Similarly, the payload of the IP datagram consists of the entirety of a TCP or UDP packet.

Understanding the structure and fields of an IP datagram helps in comprehending the layered approach of networking, where each layer is necessary for the layer above it.
