# 🌐 Introducing the Network Layer and IP Addressing 🌐

## Introduction

On a local area network (LAN), communication between nodes is facilitated through their physical MAC addresses. This approach works well on a small scale, as switches can quickly learn and map MAC addresses to their respective ports for efficient transmission. However, MAC addressing is not a scalable solution. With every network interface worldwide having a unique MAC address, and no systematic order to them, it becomes challenging to communicate across vast distances. In this lesson, we will explore the network layer, specifically the Internet Protocol (IP) and IP addresses, as an alternative solution.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- 🔢 Identify an IP address and its significance.
- 📦 Describe the encapsulation of IP datagrams within the payload of an Ethernet frame.
- 📜 Correctly identify and explain the various fields present in an IP datagram header.

## Lesson Overview 📚

In this lesson, we will cover the following topics:

1. The Limitations of MAC Addressing
   - Understanding the challenges of scaling MAC addressing for long-distance communication.
   - Exploring the limitations of MAC address learning and translation on a single network segment.

2. The Network Layer and IP Addressing
   - Introducing the network layer and its role in facilitating communication across networks.
   - Exploring the Internet Protocol (IP) and the significance of IP addresses.

3. Encapsulation of IP Datagrams
