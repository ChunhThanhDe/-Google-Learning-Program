# 🌐 Understanding IP Addresses and Allocation 🌐

## Introduction

IP addresses are 32-bit numbers composed of four octets, with each octet represented in decimal format. An octet, consisting of eight bits, can represent decimal numbers from 0 to 255. For example, 12.34.56.78 is a valid IP address, while 123.456.789.100 would not be valid as it exceeds the representation range of eight bits. This representation is known as dotted decimal notation. In an upcoming lesson on subnetting, we will delve deeper into this topic. For now, it is important to understand that IP addresses are distributed in large sections to various organizations and companies, instead of being determined by hardware vendors. This hierarchical distribution makes IP addresses more manageable and easier to store information about compared to physical addresses.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- 🔢 Describe the structure of an IP address and its representation in dotted decimal notation.
- 🌍 Understand the hierarchical distribution of IP addresses to organizations and companies.
- 🔄 Comprehend the concept of routing based on IP addresses.
- 🌐 Differentiate between MAC addresses and IP addresses in terms of network ownership.

## Lesson Overview 📚

This lesson covers the following topics:

1. IP Address Structure and Dotted Decimal Notation
   - Understanding the composition of IP addresses and their representation in decimal format.
   - Exploring the limitations of representing IP addresses with eight bits.

2. Hierarchical Distribution of IP Addresses
   - Examining how IP addresses are allocated in large sections to organizations and companies.
   - Illustrating the advantages of a hierarchical distribution system.

3. Routing Based on IP Addresses
   - Exploring the role of IP addresses in determining the path of data packets across the internet.
   - Highlighting the benefits of hierarchical IP address allocation for routing.

4. IP Addresses and Network Ownership
   - Differentiating between IP addresses and MAC addresses in terms of network ownership.
   - Understanding how IP addresses are assigned to devices on local area networks (LANs).

5. Dynamic vs. Static IP Addresses
   - Introducing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) as a technology for automatically assigning IP addresses.
   - Explaining the distinction between dynamic and static IP addresses and their typical use cases.
