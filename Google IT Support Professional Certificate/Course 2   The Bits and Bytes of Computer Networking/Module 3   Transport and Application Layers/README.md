## 📡 Module 3: Transport and Application Layers

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

* 🔌 Describe TCP ports and sockets
* 🔍 Examine the different components of a TCP header
* ⚖️ Compare differences between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols
* 🛡️ Explain how TCP is used to ensure data integrity

### 🗺️ Module Overview

This module delves into the transport and application layers of the TCP/IP model. You'll gain a comprehensive understanding of:

* **TCP ports and sockets:** Learn how these key elements facilitate communication between applications on different devices.
* **TCP header structure:** Explore the various fields within a TCP header and their roles in data transmission.
* **Connection-oriented vs. connectionless protocols:** Understand the fundamental differences between these two types of protocols and their suitability for various applications.
* **TCP and data integrity:** Discover how TCP employs mechanisms like sequence numbers and checksums to ensure reliable data delivery.

### 💡 Key Concepts

* **TCP ports:** Virtual channels on a device that identify specific applications.
* **Sockets:** Endpoints of communication established between two applications.
* **TCP header:** Contains information about the source and destination ports, sequence numbers, and other data transmission details.
* **Connection-oriented protocols:** Establish a dedicated connection between two devices before data exchange.
* **Connectionless protocols:** Send data packets independently without establishing a connection.
* **TCP data integrity:** Achieved through mechanisms like sequence numbers, checksums, and acknowledgments to ensure data arrives correctly and in the right order.
