# Introduction to Transport and Application Layers

ðŸ“š **Overview**

The first three layers of a network model have helped us describe how individual nodes on a network can communicate with other nodes on either their own network or others. But we haven't discussed how individual computer programs can communicate with each other. It's time to dive into this because that's really the aim of computer networking. We network computers together, not just so they can send data to each other, but because we want programs running on those computers to be able to send data to each other. This is where the transport and application layers of our networking model come into play.

## The Transport Layer

ðŸ”Œ **Directing Traffic to Applications**

In short, the transport layer allows traffic to be directed to specific network applications. It ensures that data sent from one program on a computer reaches the correct program on another computer. It does this by using **ports** to identify different applications or services running on a computer.

## The Application Layer

ðŸ’¬ **Enabling Communication between Applications**

The application layer allows network applications to communicate in a way they understand. It provides a standardized set of protocols and services that enable different programs to exchange data. Examples of protocols at the application layer include HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe TCP ports and sockets
- Identify the different components of a TCP header
- Show the difference between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols
- Explain how TCP is used to ensure data integrity

## Let's Get Started!

ðŸš€ Are you ready to be transported to the next lesson? I hope so because the transport layer is up next. See you there!
