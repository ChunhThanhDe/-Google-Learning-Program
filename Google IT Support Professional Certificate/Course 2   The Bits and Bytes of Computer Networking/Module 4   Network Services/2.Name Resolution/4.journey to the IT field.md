## Passion and Drive in IT 💡


When you're working in IT, you work with a bunch of different systems. It could be servers, databases, and a variety of operating systems. As a network engineer, you have to know how all those things work together. 

## 👨‍🎓 Overcoming Learning Challenges

Personally, growing up, I had a learning disorder, so I never felt academics was a strong suit for me. I used to think that pursuing a career in computers, programming, or networking required being a genius, excelling in math and science, and getting straight A's. However, I realized that it's not about your level of intelligence. It's more about your passion and how driven you are to learn. You don't have to be a genius; you just have to be driven and able to teach yourself things and advance yourself. The best advice I received from a mentor was, "Maximize your potential." This advice applies to all areas of life, especially in IT and any career in technology. You may never be the smartest person in the room, but it's about your own path and career. Focus on your own journey and don't compare yourself to others.

## 🎓 Formal Education in IT

I don't believe formal education is necessary for a role in IT. There are many paths to get there, and different people take different routes. If you're worried about not having a four-year degree or specific credentials, it's okay. In IT, as long as you have the necessary knowledge and foundations, you can achieve the career success you desire. When you consider the role that technology plays in our daily lives, it just makes sense. Personally, I love solving problems and being challenged. Technology provides limitless challenges and puzzles to solve. I always tell people that working in IT is a starting ground, a foundation for whatever you want to pursue next. It's an umbrella of technologies, allowing you to explore various paths and gradually specialize if you choose to.

🌟 Remember, it's your passion, drive, and continuous learning that will shape your success in IT!
