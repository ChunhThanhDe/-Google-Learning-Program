### **Proxy Services: Introduction and Types**

🌐 A proxy service is a server that acts on behalf of a client to access another service. Proxies provide various benefits such as anonymity, security, content filtering, and increased performance.

🔒 Proxies exist at different layers of the networking model and come in various types. Let's explore some common examples:

#### 1. Web Proxies

🌐 Web proxies are specifically built for web traffic and serve multiple purposes. In the past, organizations used web proxies to enhance performance when internet connections were slower. The web proxy would retrieve webpage data from the internet and cache it. Consequently, subsequent requests for the same webpage could be served from the cache, improving efficiency.

❗ However, with faster internet connections and dynamic web content, the use of web proxies for performance gains has diminished. Instead, web proxies are commonly employed to restrict access to websites like Twitter during work hours, aiming to enhance productivity.

#### 2. Reverse Proxies

⚡️ Reverse proxies act as an intermediary between external clients and multiple servers located behind them. They allow popular websites like Twitter to handle heavy traffic by distributing incoming requests among multiple web servers. From the client's perspective, it appears as if they are connected to a single server, while the reverse proxy balances the load across different physical servers.

🔑 Additionally, reverse proxies are often utilized for decryption purposes. As a significant portion of web traffic is now encrypted, reverse proxies leverage specialized hardware to handle the resource-intensive encryption and decryption processes. This enables web servers to focus solely on serving content.

🌟 These are just a few examples of the numerous flavors of proxies available. The key takeaway is that proxies act as intermediaries between clients and servers, providing additional functionality and benefits.

👏 Great job! We've covered a lot of information about proxy services.
