# Mastering Name Resolution with nslookup 🔍

## The Power of nslookup 💻
As an IT support specialist, understanding name resolution is crucial. The most common tool for this task is `nslookup`, available on Linux, Mac, and Windows. `nslookup` allows you to perform DNS lookups and investigate the behind-the-scenes processes.

### Basic Usage 🌐
Running `nslookup` with a hostname, such as `nslookup twitter.com`, will display the IP address (A record) associated with that domain.

### Interactive Mode 🤖
Entering `nslookup` without a hostname will launch the interactive mode, where you can run multiple queries in a row. This mode provides additional capabilities:

- `server <address>`: Set a specific DNS server to use for the following queries.
- `set type=<record_type>`: Specify the resource record type to look up, such as CNAME, MX, or TXT.
- `set debug`: Enable verbose mode, showing the full response packets and intermediary requests.

## Digging Deeper 🔍
The `nslookup` tool offers a wealth of features for in-depth troubleshooting and understanding the inner workings of name resolution. By leveraging its interactive mode and advanced options, you can gain valuable insights into the DNS ecosystem and how it functions.
