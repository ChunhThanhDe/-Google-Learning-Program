# The Internet and Connectivity Technologies

The internet is a vast and diverse place. Not only is it huge, but the number of different devices connected to it can be just as staggering. And if we were to actually describe all these devices, they'd have an almost endless number of functions. 

## Device Categories
The devices that connect to the internet fall into familiar silos, including:

- Desktop and laptop computers
- Servers and data centers
- Routers and switches that direct network traffic

But this list also includes other devices such as:
- Tablets and cell phones
- ATMs
- Industrial equipment
- Medical devices
- Some cars

The list could go on and on. 

## Layers of Connectivity
It's nice and simple to discuss everything in terms of a basic physical layer made up of Cat five or Cat six cables and a data link layer made entirely of Ethernet. But that's not exactly how things work when they actually connect to the internet. The technologies used to get people and devices connected are as different as the people and devices themselves. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
- Describe various internet connectivity technologies.
- Define the components of internet connectivity.
- Outline the basics of wireless and cellular networking.

These are important skills for an IT support specialist because a big part of your job will be making sure people can get online. ðŸ˜Š
