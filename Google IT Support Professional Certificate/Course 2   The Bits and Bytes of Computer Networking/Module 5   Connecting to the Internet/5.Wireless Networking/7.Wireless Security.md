## 🔒 Wireless Network Security

When it comes to wireless networking, ensuring data privacy and security is crucial. Here are some important aspects to consider:

### Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
🔐 WEP was an encryption technology developed to provide privacy for wireless networks.  
📡 However, WEP is considered weak and offers only a low level of security.  
🔓 Its encryption algorithm can be easily cracked, exposing transmitted data.  
🔑 WEP uses a 40-bit encryption key, making it vulnerable to attacks with modern computing power.

### Wifi Protected Access (WPA)
🔒 WPA replaced WEP as a more secure option for wireless network encryption.  
🔐 By default, WPA uses a 128-bit encryption key, significantly stronger than WEP.  
💡 WPA2, an update to WPA, is currently the most commonly used encryption algorithm for wireless networks.  
🔑 WPA2 employs a 256-bit encryption key, making it even more difficult to crack.

### MAC Filtering
🔒 MAC filtering adds an additional layer of security to wireless networks.  
📱 MAC addresses uniquely identify network devices.  
🔒 By configuring access points to allow connections only from trusted MAC addresses, unauthorized devices are prevented from connecting to the network.  
🔐 MAC filtering doesn't encrypt wireless traffic but safeguards against unauthorized network access.
