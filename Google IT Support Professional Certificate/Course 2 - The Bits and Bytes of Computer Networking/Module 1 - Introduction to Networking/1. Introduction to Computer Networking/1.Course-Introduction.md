# 🎓 Course: The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking

## Welcome

👋 Welcome to Course 2, The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking! Whether you're joining us for the first time or have previously taken the Internet lessons in the first course, I'm here to guide you through this exciting journey. My name is Victor Escobedo, and I'm a Corporate Operations Engineer. Let's embark on a fascinating exploration of computer networking!

## My Journey into IT

🔍 You might be wondering how I found my passion for IT. It all started when I was nine years old and my dad brought home our first computer. As a mechanical engineer, he used the computer for his Cadwork. Fascinated by this new device, I discovered that I could install software, including computer games. As I tinkered with the computer, my curiosity grew, leading me to open up the case and explore its inner workings. Learning through trial and error, I became captivated by the mechanics of how it all worked together. These early experiences sowed the seeds that inspired my career in IT.

💡 However, pursuing a career in tech wasn't commonly discussed or encouraged where I grew up. As a first-generation Mexican American, I didn't have many role models in the field. While my friends and family focused on high school graduation and job security, I nurtured my passion for computers. Although my school lacked technical resources, my parents encouraged me to work hard and pursue my interest. They couldn't provide guidance on college or a tech career due to their limited experience.

🎓 When the time came, I decided to study computer science in college, driven by my desire to understand computers at a fundamental level. This foundational knowledge proved invaluable in grasping higher-level concepts essential to a career in IT. During my college years, I took my first job in IT, working for a small local company. Fast forward twelve years, and I've spent the past seven years at Google, managing large-scale IT projects. As a Corporate Operations Engineer, my role involves understanding the impact of changes on our corporate infrastructure, making networking skills critical.

## The Importance of Networking

🌐 Computers communicate much like humans do. Effective communication requires a shared language and the ability to hear and understand each other. Similarly, computers follow a set of rules, known as protocols, to communicate properly. Computer networking encompasses the full scope of how computers interact with each other. It involves ensuring they can hear each other, speak compatible protocols, and handle messages that may not be fully delivered.

🔌 To understand computer networking, we rely on models that describe the different layers involved in the process. In this course, we'll focus on the TCP/IP five-layer model, while also touching upon the OSI model, which consists of seven layers. Don't worry if these models are new to you—we'll dive into them extensively throughout the course. Understanding layered models is crucial because computer networking is complex, with protocols at each layer facilitating the movement of data from one place to another.

🔧 Sometimes, computers encounter issues when attempting to communicate over the internet or business networks. It often falls to IT support specialists to troubleshoot and resolve these problems. That's why comprehending computer networking is vital. By the end of this course, you'll be able to explain all five layers of our model. Additionally, you'll gain insight into how computers determine where to send messages and how network services like DNS and DHCP function. You'll also acquire proficiency in using powerful tools to troubleshoot network issues.
