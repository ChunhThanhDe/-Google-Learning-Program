# Ethernet Over Twisted Pair Technologies 🌐🔗🔀

📚 **Supplemental Reading for Ethernet Over Twisted Pair Technologies** 📚

In this reading, we will explore the significance of Ethernet over twisted pair technologies. Twisted pair Ethernet cables are widely used in both business and home networks. When connecting to the internet, coaxial or fiber-optic cables are typically employed to link a building or home with an internet service provider (ISP). Inside the premises, the internet connection is passed through a gateway modem (often provided by the ISP) using a twisted pair Ethernet cable. From there, the connection is further distributed to a router or a single computer. These internal wired connections within a network are facilitated by twisted pair Ethernet cables, also known as CAT cables. You may have come across Ethernet CAT5 or CAT6 cables for your home internet connection. Additionally, Ethernet over twisted pair technologies can support telephone and television services in both residential and commercial settings.

## Twisted Pair Cables 🌐🔀

Originally, telephone and early data cables consisted of two copper wires—one for transmitting data and one for receiving data—running in parallel. However, this configuration was susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio frequency interference (RFI), and crosstalk between the wires. To address these issues, engineers introduced a solution: twisting the wire pair together. This twisting reduced some of the unwanted noise on the lines.

### Advantages of Twisted Pair Ethernet Cables 🌐🔀

Twisted pair Ethernet cables are commonly used in Local Area Networks (LANs) due to the following advantages:

- **Multiple levels of interference protection:** Twisted pair cables offer protection against EMI, RFI, and crosstalk. Different levels of protection are available, allowing for cost-effective options suitable for home users and small businesses.

- **Thin, lightweight, and flexible:** These cables are easy to install and move around as needed.

- **Suitable for short distances:** Twisted pair cables are ideal for connections within buildings and homes.

- **Support for data and voice communications:** The cable's frequency range enables the transmission of data as well as telephone/voice communications.

## UTP, STP, and FTP Ethernet Cables 🌐🔀

Twisted pair Ethernet cables utilize four pairs of color-coded copper wires. Each pair consists of one solid-colored wire and one striped wire, which are twisted together. There are different types of twisted pair Ethernet cables available, categorized as follows:

- **Unshielded twisted pair (UTP):** This is the most common and cost-effective type of Ethernet cable used in both home and business networks. UTP cables provide basic protection against EMI, RFI, and crosstalk interference.

- **Shielded twisted pair (STP):** STP cables are employed in environments where EMI, RFI, and crosstalk with nearby cables pose challenges to network communications. These cables feature a braided aluminum and/or copper shielding that encases the four twisted pairs beneath the outer jacket.

- **Foiled twisted pair (FTP):** Similar to STP cables, FTP cables are used in environments where interference is a concern. They utilize a thin foil shield that wraps around the bundle of twisted pair wires beneath the outer jacket.

The terms "STP" and "FTP" are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to shielded and/or foiled cables. Additionally, STP and FTP cables may incorporate both braided and foiled shields for enhanced interference protection. It is important to review the manufacturer's description to determine the specific interference-reducing method employed in a given Ethernet cable. Furthermore, UTP, STP, and FTP Ethernet cables can be manufactured with braided and/or foil shields around each of the four twisted pairs, although this configuration increases the cost. In industrial environments with higher-than-normal EMI and/or RFI, a shielded with foiled twisted pair (SF/FTP) configuration is often used.

## Straight-through Cables 🌐🔀

Straight-through cables, also known as patch cables, are the primary type of Ethernet cable used in computer networks. They are typically used to connect computers, routers, and servers to hubs and Ethernet switches.

Straight-through cables can be identified by comparing both ends of the cable. If the color and stripe order of the twisted pairs are in the same position on both ends, it is a straight-through cable. For example, if an orange-striped wire appears in pin position 1 on one end, it should also appear in pin position 1 on the other end. This one-to-one pattern applies to each color in pin positions 2-8. It is worth noting that Ethernet cables conforming to 100Base-T standards (commonly used in home networks) do not utilize blue and brown cables. However, gigabit Ethernet networks have the option to use blue and brown cables for Power over Ethernet (PoE) purposes.

**Straight-through cable key:**

- **Computersand routers use:**
  - Pins 1 & 2: Orange wires for sending data
  - Pins 3 & 6: Green wires for receiving data

- **Hubs and switches use:**
  - Pins 1 & 2: Green wires for sending data
  - Pins 3 & 6: Orange wires for receiving data
