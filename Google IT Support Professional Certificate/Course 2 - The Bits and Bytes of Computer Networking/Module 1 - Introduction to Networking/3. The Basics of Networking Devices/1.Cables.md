## Understanding Networking Cables and Devices 📶💻🔌

In the world of computer networking, lots of different cables and network devices can be used to allow computers to properly communicate with each other. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to identify and describe various networking cables and networking devices. Computer networking is a huge part of the day-to-day role of many IT specialists. And knowing how to differentiate different network devices will be essential to your success. Let's start with the most basic component of a wired network: cables. Cables are what connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them. 

### Networking Cables 📡🔗

Most network cables used today can be split into two categories: copper and fiber. 

#### Copper Cables 🔌

Copper cables are the most common form of networking cable. They're made up of multiple pairs of copper wires inside plastic insulator. Computers communicate in binary, represented by ones and zeros. The sending device communicates binary data across these copper wires by changing the voltage between two ranges. The system at the receiving end can interpret these voltage changes as binary ones and zeros, which can then be translated into different forms of data.

The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables. These categories have different physical characteristics, such as the number of twists in the pair of copper wires, resulting in different usable lengths and transfer rates. Cat5 is older and has been mostly replaced by Cat5e and Cat6 cables.

Cat5e cables have mostly replaced the older Cat5 cables because their internals reduce Crosstalk. Crosstalk is when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire, causing a network error. Cat5e cables reduce the likelihood of data needing to be retransmitted, allowing more data to be transferred in the same amount of time.

Cat6 cables follow an even stricter specification to avoid Crosstalk, making them more expensive. Cat6 cables can transfer data faster and more reliably than Cat5e cables, but they have a shorter maximum distance when used at higher speeds.

#### Fiber Cables 📡💡

Fiber cables, short for fiber optic cables, contain individual optical fibers made out of glass. These fibers transport beams of light to represent the ones and zeros of the underlying data. Fiber cables can generally transport data quicker than copper cables and over much longer distances without suffering potential data loss. They are commonly used in environments with significant electromagnetic interference from outside sources.

### Networking Devices 🖥📶

Apart from cables, various networking devices play a crucial role in facilitating communication between computers. Let's briefly cover some of the common networking devices:

- **Routers**: 🌐 Routers allow different networks to communicate with each other by forwarding data packets between them.
- **Switches**: 🔀 Switches connect multiple devices within a local network and improve network efficiency by reducing network congestion.
- **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: 🖧 NICs are hardware components installed in computers to connect them to a network.
- **Wireless Access Points (WAPs)**: 📶 WAPs enable wireless connectivity in a network, allowing wireless devices to connect.
- **Modems**: 📡 Modems establish connections between a computer network and an external network, such as the internet.

Understanding these networking devices and their functions is essential for building and maintaining efficient computer networks.

Now that you know more about networking cables and devices, you can confidently navigate the world of computer networking. Remember, while copper cables are commonly found in offices and homes, fiber cables are typically encountered in computer data centers.
