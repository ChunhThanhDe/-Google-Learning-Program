## 📶 Cellular Networking

Cellular networking, also known as mobile networking, is a widely used form of wireless networking. It has gained popularity worldwide and is often the primary method of internet connectivity in many areas. Cellular networks share similarities with 802.11 networks, but there are notable differences. Here's an overview of cellular networking:

📡 **Wireless Connectivity**: Like Wi-Fi, cellular networking operates over radio waves and utilizes specific frequency bands dedicated to cellular transmissions.

🌍 **Global Adoption**: Cellular networks have become ubiquitous, with widespread usage across the globe.

📱 **Diverse Specifications**: Similar to the various 802.11 specifications in Wi-Fi, there are multiple cellular specifications available.

📡 **Extended Coverage**: Cellular frequencies can travel longer distances, often spanning kilometers or miles.

📶 **Cellular Cells**: Cellular networks are structured around cells, with each cell assigned a specific frequency band. Neighboring cells use non-overlapping bands, similar to optimizing WLAN setups with multiple access points.

🗼 **Cell Towers as Access Points**: Cell towers act as access points for cellular transmissions, providing coverage over a much larger range.

📱 **Diverse Device Adoption**: Beyond phones, cellular networks are utilized by tablets, select laptops, and even high-end automobiles that feature built-in cellular access.
