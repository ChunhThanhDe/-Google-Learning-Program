## 📡 Wireless Network Configurations

There are several ways to configure a wireless network:

### Ad-Hoc Networks
🔗 Nodes communicate directly with each other.  
📱 Practical applications:  
- Smartphones establishing ad-hoc networks for exchanging photos, videos, or contact information.  
- Industrial or warehouse settings where equipment needs to communicate with each other.  
- Disaster situations where existing infrastructure is damaged, and ad-hoc networks enable communication during rescue efforts.

### Wireless LANs (WLANs)
🔗 Access points bridge wireless and wired networks.  
🏢 Common in the business world.  
🌐 Wireless devices communicate with access points to access resources outside of the WLAN.  
🖧 Access points forward traffic to the gateway router for normal operation.

### Mesh Networks
🔗 Devices form a mesh by communicating wirelessly with each other.  
🔌 Most mesh networks consist of wireless access points connected to a wired network.  
🔁 Increases performance and range of the wireless network.  
📶 Additional access points can be deployed without running cables to each of them.
