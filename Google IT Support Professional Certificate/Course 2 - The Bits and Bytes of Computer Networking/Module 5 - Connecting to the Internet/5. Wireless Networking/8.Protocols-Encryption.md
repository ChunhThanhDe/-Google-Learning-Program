# 🔒 Protocols & Encryption

In the field of cybersecurity, protocols and encryption play a crucial role in ensuring network security. As technology advances and computing power increases, network security measures must evolve. In this reading, we will explore the WPA3 protocol and its encryption methods, which aim to enhance wireless security.

## WPA3 Protocols & Encryption

WPA3 is the third iteration of the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol and is designed to replace its predecessor, WPA2. WPA3 introduces new features and techniques to address the security vulnerabilities present in WPA2. The advantages of WPA3 in Wi-Fi security include:

🔒 **Simplified wireless security**
- WPA3 simplifies the process of securing wireless networks, making it easier for users to protect their devices.

🔑 **Stronger authentication**
- WPA3 improves authentication mechanisms, enhancing the security of user credentials and preventing unauthorized access.

🔐 **Powerful encryption**
- WPA3 employs robust encryption algorithms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data.

🏢 **Stable business continuity**
- WPA3 offers enhanced security methods specifically designed for enterprise networks, ensuring stable and secure connectivity.

🔒 **Replacement for legacy protocols**
- WPA3 replaces older and less secure protocols, providing a more robust security framework for wireless networks.

## WPA3-Personal

WPA3-Personal is intended for individual users and personal/home Wi-Fi networks. This protocol addresses common cybersecurity weaknesses faced by consumers and offers the following improvements:

🔐 **Natural password selection**
- Users can set passwords that are easier to remember, improving convenience without compromising security.

🚀 **Increased ease of use**
- Users can seamlessly connect to Wi-Fi networks without the need for significant changes in their connection process.

🔒 **Forward secrecy**
- If a password is stolen, WPA3 ensures that the transmitted data remains protected, even if the password is compromised.

🔐 **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)**
- WPA3-Personal enhances the handshake protocol used in WPA2, making it highly secure against cybercriminal attacks. SAE uses an intricate process to authenticate both the access point and the wireless device, significantly reducing the risk of interception.

WPA3-Personal also mitigates the likelihood of successful dictionary and brute force attacks, which target weak and commonly used passwords. Additionally, it addresses vulnerabilities exploited by cybercriminals for key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs), thereby safeguarding sensitive information transmitted over Wi-Fi networks.

## WPA3-Enterprise

WPA3-Enterprise is designed for business networks with multiple users, addressing the weaknesses of the WPA2-Enterprise protocol that cybercriminals have exploited. In addition to the enhancements mentioned in WPA3-Personal, WPA3-Enterprise provides the following security improvements and options:

🔒 **Galois/Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP-256)**
- WPA3-Enterprise utilizes the AES encryption algorithm with 256-bit GCMP encryption, replacing the less secure 128-bit AES-CCMP used in WPA2. The increased encryption strength significantly raises the difficulty for cybercriminals to crack the encryption, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. 

🔒 **Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE)**
- OWE improves upon the wireless encryption standard of WPA2 by encrypting and authenticating all wireless traffic. It replaces Wi-Fi passwords with unique keys assigned to each authorized device, addressing vulnerabilities experienced in open networks commonly found in public places.

🔒 **Wi-Fi Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP)**
- DPP simplifies the process of granting passwordless Wi-Fi access to wireless devices. It utilizes QR codes or NFC tags to establish secure connections between devices and routers.

🔐 **384-bit Hashed Message Authentication Mode (HMAC) with Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)**
- HMAC generates hash codes from secret keys, enabling the authentication of messages exchanged between Wi-Fi access points and user devices. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of transmitted data.

🔑 **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Exchange (ECDHE) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)**
- WPA3 incorporates the ECDHE protocol and ECDSA encryption for key management and authentication, providing faster performance. This technology replaces the 4-way handshake used in WPA2.
