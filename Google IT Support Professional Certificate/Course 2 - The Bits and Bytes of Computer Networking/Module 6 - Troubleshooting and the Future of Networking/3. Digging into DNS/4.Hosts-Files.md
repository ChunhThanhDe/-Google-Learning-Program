# Before DNS: The Legacy of Host Files 🗂️

## Mapping Words to Network Addresses ✍️
Before the establishment of the global and widely available Domain Name System (DNS), computer operators recognized the need for a language-based system to refer to network devices. Humans are better at remembering descriptive words rather than numerical IP addresses, which are the native language of computers.

## The Host File: A Simple Solution 📄
The original method of correlating numerical network addresses with descriptive words was through host files - flat files containing a network address followed by the corresponding host name on each line. For example, a line might read "1.2.3.4 web server", allowing users to refer to the IP address 1.2.3.4 as "web server".

## The Loopback Address: A Persistent Entry 🔁
One notable entry found in host files is the loopback address, which always points to the local machine. The IPv4 loopback address is 127.0.0.1, and it is configured on every modern operating system through a host file entry, typically along with the IPv6 loopback address, ::1.

## The Continued Relevance of Host Files 🧭
Although DNS has become the dominant system for translating domain names to IP addresses, host files still have their place. Some software requires specific entries in the host file to operate properly, and host files can also be used for troubleshooting purposes. However, caution is advised, as host files can be a target for computer viruses to disrupt and redirect user traffic.

## The Evolution of Address Resolution 🌐
Host files are examined before a DNS resolution attempt on most major operating systems, allowing users to force a specific domain name to point to a particular IP address on an individual computer. This feature highlights the importance of understanding the legacy of host files in the development of modern networking technologies.
