## Computer Language

### 🖥️ **Overview:** 
This presentation explains the basic concepts of computers and the binary system. It begins by stating that a computer is a device that stores and processes data through calculations. The level of tasks a computer can accomplish depends on its computing power. By the end of this lesson, you will understand what a computer calculates and how it operates. 🧬

### 🧮 **Example of Simple Calculation:**
 Let's consider a simple math problem: "What is zero plus one?" The answer is one, and we can quickly calculate it. However, imagine if we needed to perform 100 calculations that are equally simple. It can be done, but we must be careful to avoid mistakes. Now, what if we needed to do 1,000 of these calculations? How about a million? How about a billion? This is precisely what a computer does. A computer compares ones and zeros, but millions or billions of times per second.⚡

### 📶 **Binary System:** 
The communication used by a computer is referred to as the binary system, also known as the base-2 numeral system. It means that a computer communicates using only ones and zeros. You might wonder, "My computer only speaks in ones and zeros. How do I communicate with it?" Think of it this way. We use the letters of the alphabet to form words, and we assign meaning to those words. We use them to create sentences, paragraphs, and entire stories. The same principle applies to binary, except we only have zero and one to create meaningful words. 💬

### 🔢 **Grouping in Bytes:** 
In computing terms, binary is grouped into eight numbers or bits. Technically, a bit is a binary digit. Historically, we use eight bits because early computer hardware utilized the base-2 numeral system for bit manipulation. Two to the power of eight provides a sufficient range of values for the computing needs. Initially, different bit groupings were used, but eventually, the grouping of eight bits became the industry standard we use today. It's important to know that a group of eight bits is called a byte. A byte, represented as a sequence of zeros and ones (e.g., 10011011), can store one character, with 256 possible values due to the base-2 system (two to the power of eight). In computer terminology, this byte can represent something like the letter "c." This is how computer language is born. 🖥️

### 🗂️ **Translating Binary:** 
Let's create a quick table to translate something a computer might see into something we can recognize. What does the following binary sequence translate to? Did you get "hello"? Pretty cool! By using binary, we can achieve unlimited communication with our computer. Everything we see on our computer, whether it's a video, an image, text, or anything else, is ultimately represented as a series of ones and zeros. Understanding how binary works is crucial as it forms the foundation for everything we will do in this course. Make sure you grasp the concept before moving forward. 📚
