## Nontraditional Backgrounds in IT

ðŸ‘¥ We have a lot of people that have nontraditional backgrounds who have made it here at Google. I've worked with people who have history degrees, economic degrees, and they're writing scripts, automating processes for clients. People often have a misconception that you need to follow a traditional path to succeed in IT. While many people do follow that path and succeed, the benefit of IT is that ultimately, people just want to know whether or not you can fix the problem.

ðŸ”§ Make sure you have strong fundamentals because they do end up coming back. Sometimes people think they don't need to worry about low-level stuff like understanding the TCP/IP model or the OSI model. They believe they can focus solely on a specific application or program they'll be working with. However, there are instances where having that foundational knowledge becomes integral to solving a problem.

ðŸš€ As long as you're able to reach a point where you feel comfortable working with users, fixing their problems, and providing them with the best support possible, you'll always be valuable in the world of IT. Remember, your background doesn't define your potential in this field.

ðŸ’ª Embrace the diversity of experiences and knowledge in IT, and focus on continually improving your skills and problem-solving abilities. You'll find success regardless of your background.
