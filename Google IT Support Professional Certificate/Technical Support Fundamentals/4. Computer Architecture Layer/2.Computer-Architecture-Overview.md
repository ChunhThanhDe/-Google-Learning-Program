# Layers of a Computer System

📺 In the last video, I mentioned that people don't need to understand how a computer works for them to use it because abstraction makes things simpler for us. That's technically true, but since you're stepping into the world of IT, you do need to understand all the layers of a computer and how they work. It's essential that you understand how the different pieces interact so you can resolve any issues that may arise.

## The Four Layers

🖥️ The computer can be divided into four main layers: hardware, operating system, software, and users.

### Hardware Layer

💻 The hardware layer is made up of the physical components of a computer. These are objects you can physically hold in your hand: laptops, phones, monitors, keyboards, and more. In the next lesson, you'll learn about all the components of a computer and how they work. By the end of this module, you'll even be able to build your own computer.

### Operating System Layer

🔧 The operating system allows hardware to communicate with the system. Since hardware is created by many different manufacturers, the operating system allows them to be used with our system regardless of where they came from. In the next few lessons, you'll learn about the major operating systems that we use today and gain an understanding of all the underlying components that make up an operating system. This knowledge will help you navigate any operating system.

### Software Layer

📦 The software layer is how we as humans interact with our computers. When you use a computer, you're given a vast amount of software to interact with. It could be a mobile app, a web browser, a word processor, or even the operating system itself. Later in this course, we'll learn how software is installed on our systems and how we interact with different types of software.

### User Layer

🤝 The user layer is where the user interacts with the computer. While it may not seem like it's part of the system, it's an essential layer of the computer architecture. The user layer is one of the most important layers we'll learn about. When you step into the field of IT, you may have your hands full with the technical aspects, but remember, the most important part of IT is the human element. While we work with computers every day, it is the user interaction that makes up most of our job, from responding to user emails to fixing their computers. By the end of the course, you'll also learn how to apply your knowledge of how a computer works to fix real-world issues that can sometimes seem random and obscure. We'll do this by learning how to utilize problem-solving tactics to identify issues and solutions.

📚 There's a lot ahead. The next instructor you're going to meet is a friend of mine, Devin [inaudible]. And I know there's no better person to teach you about hardware or even show you how to build a computer from its component parts. Pretty cool.
