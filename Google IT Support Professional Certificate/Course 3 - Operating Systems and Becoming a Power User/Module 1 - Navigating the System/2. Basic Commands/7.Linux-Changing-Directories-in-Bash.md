# Navigating the File System in Bash 🐧

## Exploring the Desktop and Documents Folders 🗂️

Let's do the same thing in Bash. From our desktop, we're going to navigate to the
Documents folder. The commands we used earlier in PowerShell are exactly
the same here in Bash.

Print working directory 
or `PWD` again, shows us the current path
we are in. Looks good. We're currently in our
desktop directory, which you can see from
`/home/cindy/desktop`. To navigate around, we
use the `CD` command, just like with Windows. We can give it an
absolute path like this, `cd /home/cindy/documents`,
or we can give it a relative path like
this, `cd ../documents`. In Bash, the Tilde `~` is used to reference
our home directory, so `cd ~/desktop` will take
us back to our desktop. 🏠

## Tab Completion in Bash 💻

Guess what, we still have that useful tab completion
feature in Bash. The difference between Bash
tab complete and Windows tab complete is that if
we have multiple options, it won't rotate
through the options, but instead will show
us all options at once. Like this, we can already start connecting the bridge
between Windows and Linux. 🌉
