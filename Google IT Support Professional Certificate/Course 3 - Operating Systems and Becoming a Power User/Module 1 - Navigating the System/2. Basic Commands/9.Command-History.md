# Window: Efficient Directory Management in Bash 🚀

## Creating Multiple Directories 📁

Let's say we want to make
a couple of directories. `my cool folder two` and
`my cool folder three`. We could just type `mkdir
my cool folder two` and then type again `mkdir
my cool folder three`. But instead we're going to use another
cool Bash feature called history. 🕰️

## Utilizing Bash History 🗄️

Each and every time you enter in
a command, it gets saved into memory and add it to a special file. You can go through the previous commands
you used with the `history` command. I'm now showing a list of
commands that I entered earlier. This information alone isn't very useful. Instead, there's a better use of
the history that lets us quickly scroll through these commands and use them again. 🔍

We can scroll through these commands with
the up or down keys on our keyboard. I'm going to go up to
my previous command and I should see that I had
`mkdir my cool folder`. Instead of typing the whole
thing to make a new folder, I'm just going to append
the number two to my command. Boom, a new file was created without
having to type everything over again. Cool, right? 😎

You can even search through your
previously used commands using the history shortcut, `Ctrl-R`. From here, you can start typing bits and
pieces of the command you want to look for and I'll show you matches. Let's search for the word `folder`. I should see the `mkdir`
commands I was using before. Pretty neat. 🧠

If you're using an older
version of Bash, it may not have the `Ctrl-R` feature. If that's the case, you can type the `#`
symbol followed by some part of your old command and then use tab completion to
cycle through the items in your history. 🔍

The history feature along
with tab completion and `get-help` will be your best
friends while you work in Bash. Keep them close to you and
get to know them super well. 🤝

## Clearing the Terminal 🧹

Our shell is looking a little cluttered. It's kind of hard to see where I'm at. So let's clean up our shell a little bit. We can do that with the `clear` command. This doesn't wipe your history,
it just clears the output on your screen. It looks a little better. 🧹

# Linux: Bash History and Clearing the Terminal 🤖

## Bash History 📜

The exact same history
command that's used in Windows
is used in Linux. From here, we can use our up and down keys and even
search through our history with `Ctrl-R`. 🔍

## Clearing the Terminal 🧹

To clear your terminal up, what do you think you do? 🤔

That's right. The `clear` command. 💻
