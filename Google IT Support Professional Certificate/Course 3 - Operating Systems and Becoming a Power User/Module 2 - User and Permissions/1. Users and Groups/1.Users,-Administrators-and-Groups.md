# 👥 Managing Users and Permissions

## 🤖 Welcome Back!

Now that we've learned how to navigate around the Windows and Linux operating systems, let's start setting up our computer for use by other people. As an IT support specialist, you'll be responsible for other people's machines. 

People will depend on you to help set up their machines, troubleshoot their issues, and so on. In this lesson, you'll learn how to manage multiple accounts on one machine.

## 📚 Key Topics

- Different types of users: Standard and Administrator
- Adding, removing, and modifying users
- Assigning permissions and access levels
- Best practices for managing multiple users

## 🔑 Understanding User Accounts

It's common for a computer to have multiple users. On your home computer, you might have your parents, siblings, or children using the same computer. Your town, library, school, or other public places might also have computers with multiple users.

Even though these machines have multiple user accounts, all users on a computer are isolated from others. This means that Kevin can't see Victor's files and folders, and vice versa.

## 🔒 User Types

There are two different types of users:

1. **Standard User**: This user is given access to a machine, but has restricted access to do things like install software or change certain settings.

2. **Administrator (Admin)**: This user has complete control over a machine. They can view anyone's account, change and remove anyone on the computer, and view every single file.

You can have multiple administrators on a machine as well. On your personal machine, you're the default administrator because this gives you complete control over your system.

## 🧑‍💻 Managing Users and Groups

Users are put together in groups according to levels of access and permissions to carry out certain tasks. These tasks depend on what the computer's administrator considers appropriate.

An administrator could give different access and settings based on the type of group a user is in. For example, as an administrator for your home computer, you could put your parents in a "Parents" group and your kids in a "Children" group, with different permissions for each.

## 🖥️ Identifying User Types

How do you differentiate what type of user you are and what groups you're in on Windows and Linux? Well, hopefully you'd know this if you're an administrator of a computer. But if you don't, computers do a pretty good job of telling you.
