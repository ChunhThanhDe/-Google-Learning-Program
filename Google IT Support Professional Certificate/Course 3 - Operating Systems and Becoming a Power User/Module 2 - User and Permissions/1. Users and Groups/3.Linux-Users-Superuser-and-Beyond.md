## Linux User Management 🐧

In Linux, user management works just like it does in Windows - different user types have different privileges and they can be grouped together with various access levels. However, there are a few differences in how Linux does labeling:

- **Standard Users**: Regular user accounts in Linux
- **Administrators**: Users with elevated privileges
- **Root User**: A special user account with full access to the OS

The Root User is the first user that gets automatically created when we install a Linux OS. This user has all the privileges on the OS and is considered the "super user". 🔑

### Viewing Protected Files ⚠️

Let's try to view the contents of a restricted file, `/etc/sudoers`:

```
cat /etc/sudoers
# Permission denied
```

The `sudoers` file is a protected file that can only be read by the Root user. We can log in as Root and run the command with no problem:

```
sudo cat /etc/sudoers
# Able to view contents
```

However, it's generally not a good idea to always be logged in as Root, as it has unrestricted access and any mistakes could be catastrophic. 💥

### Using `sudo` 🔼

Instead, we can use the `sudo` command (superuser do) to run a single command as Root:

```
sudo cat /etc/sudoers
# Able to view contents
```

If you don't want to run `sudo` every time, you can use the `su` command (substitute user) to switch to the Root user:

```
su
root@cindy-ncy $
```

### Viewing User and Group Information 👥

You can view who has access to run `sudo` by checking the `/etc/group` file:

```
cat /etc/group
# Lists all the groups and their members
```

To view user information, the relevant file is `/etc/passwd`:

```
cat /etc/passwd
# Lots of user accounts, including non-human processes
```

The key fields in these files are:

- **Group Name**: The name of the group
- **Group ID**: The numerical identifier for the group
- **User Name**: The username
- **User ID**: The numerical identifier for the user

Overall, Linux user management is similar to Windows, but with some unique terminology and file locations. Just remember to use `sudo` judiciously and be careful when working as the Root user! 🐧💻
