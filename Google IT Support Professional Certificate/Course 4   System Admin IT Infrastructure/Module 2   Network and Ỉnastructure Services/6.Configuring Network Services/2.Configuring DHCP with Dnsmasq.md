### Configuring DHCP with Dnsmasq üåêüì°

Dnsmasq is a versatile tool that provides DNS, DHCP, TFTP, and PXE services. Here, we focus on using Dnsmasq as a DHCP server. Here's a summary of the key points:

#### **Overview of DHCP Configuration**

1. **DHCP Server Basics**
   - A DHCP server assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
   - It operates on a machine or device with a static IP address and is connected to the network it serves.
   - In practice, DHCP servers and clients usually run on separate machines, but for simulation, we use a single machine.

2. **Interface Configuration**
   - **DHCP Server Interface (`eth_srv`)**: This interface will serve DHCP requests. Example IP: `192.168.1.1` with a subnet mask `/24`.
   - **DHCP Client Interface (`eth_cli`)**: This interface will request an IP address from the DHCP server. Initially, it has no IP configured.

3. **Basic DHCP Configuration with Dnsmasq**
   - Create a configuration file (`dhcp.config`) with the following options:
     - `interface`: Specifies which interface Dnsmasq listens to for DHCP requests.
     - `bind-interfaces`: Ensures Dnsmasq only listens on the specified interface.
     - `domain`: Provides the network domain name to clients.
     - `dhcp-option`: Configures additional information for clients (e.g., default gateway, DNS servers).
     - `dhcp-range`: Defines the range of IP addresses available for lease, and the lease duration (e.g., 12 hours).

4. **Starting Dnsmasq**
   - Run Dnsmasq with the command: 
     ```bash
     sudo dnsmasq -d -q -C dhcp.config
     ```
   - This command starts Dnsmasq with debugging information and the specified configuration file.

5. **Testing DHCP Functionality**
   - Use a DHCP client (`dhclient`) to request an IP address from `eth_cli`:
     ```bash
     sudo dhclient -i eth_cli -v
     ```
   - This command shows the exchange of packets and acquisition of an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.80`).

6. **Verification and Results**
   - After acquiring an IP address, use `dig` to query the DNS server:
     ```bash
     dig @localhost instance-1
     ```
   - Dnsmasq not only assigns IP addresses but also provides DNS services, resolving local queries based on its configuration.

7. **Best Practices**
   - Perform simulations and tests on a separate network from production to avoid disruptions.

### Summary

- **Dnsmasq** is a lightweight solution that can serve both DNS and DHCP functions effectively.
- **Configuration** involves setting up interfaces, configuring DHCP options, and starting Dnsmasq with appropriate settings.
- **Testing** with `dhclient` and `dig` ensures that Dnsmasq is functioning correctly.

This setup demonstrates the dual role of Dnsmasq in managing both DNS and DHCP services, offering a compact yet powerful solution for network management. üöÄüîß
