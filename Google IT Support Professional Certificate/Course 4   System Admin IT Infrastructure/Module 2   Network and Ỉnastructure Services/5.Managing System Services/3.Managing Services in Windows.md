Managing services on Windows involves using commands and graphical tools to check the status, and start or stop services. Here‚Äôs a practical guide using the Windows Update service as an example.

**Service Management Commands**

1. **Checking Service Status**:

     ```powershell
     Get-Service
     ```
   - For specific services, such as Windows Update (`wuauserv`):
     ```powershell
     Get-Service wuauserv
     ```
   - To get detailed information:
     ```powershell
     Get-Service wuauserv | Format-List
     ```

2. **Stopping and Starting Services**:
   - **Stop a Service**:
     ```powershell
     Stop-Service wuauserv
     ```
   - **Start a Service**:
     ```powershell
     Start-Service wuauserv
     ```
   - Verify the service status after starting or stopping:
     ```powershell
     Get-Service wuauserv
     ```

3. **Listing All Services**:
   - To list all services:
     ```powershell
     Get-Service
     ```

**Graphical Management**:
   - Open the Services Management Console:
     - Go to **Start** > **Run** > type `services.msc` and hit Enter.
   - This console displays all registered services:

     - To stop or start a service, right-click on the service and select the appropriate action.

   - To manage the Windows Update service:
     - **Check Status**: Open PowerShell and run `Get-Service wuauserv`.
     - **Stop Service**: Run `Stop-Service wuauserv`.
     - **Start Service**: Run `Start-Service wuauserv`.
     - **List All Services**: Run `Get-Service`.

**Summary**
