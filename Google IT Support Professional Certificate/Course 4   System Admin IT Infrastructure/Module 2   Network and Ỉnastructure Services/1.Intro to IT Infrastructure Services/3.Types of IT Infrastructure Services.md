  - **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Offers Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.
  - **Linode**: Provides virtual servers.
  - **Microsoft Azure**: Includes various cloud services.
  - **Google Compute Engine**: Another prominent option.

#### 3. **Networking Services** 🌐🔗

- **Networking as a Service (NaaS)**: Offloads networking services to cloud providers, eliminating the need for expensive hardware and complex network management.

#### 4. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** 🖥️📦
- **Overview**: SaaS offers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for local installation and management. Examples include:
  - **Microsoft Office 365**: For document editing, spreadsheets, and presentations.
