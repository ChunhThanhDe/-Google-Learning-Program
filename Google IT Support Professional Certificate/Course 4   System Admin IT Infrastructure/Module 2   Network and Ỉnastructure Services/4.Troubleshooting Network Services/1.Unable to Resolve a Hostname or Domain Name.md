### Troubleshooting DNS Issues: Unable to Resolve a Hostname or Domain Name üåêüîç

**Overview**  
When you encounter issues resolving a hostname or domain name, it can be challenging to pinpoint the problem. This guide provides steps to troubleshoot and identify common DNS-related issues.

**Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Verify Network Connection**:  
   - Ensure your network connection is working by pinging a reliable website, such as `www.google.com`.
   - **Command**: `ping www.google.com`
   - If you receive responses, the network connection is likely fine. If not, check your network settings or connectivity.

2. **Check DNS Resolution with NS Lookup**:  
   - Use `NS lookup` to verify if your DNS server is providing the correct address for the domain.
   - **Command**: `nslookup www.google.com`
   - Compare the returned IP address with the one you have. If the DNS server is working correctly, this IP should resolve to the intended website.

3. **Direct IP Address Testing**:  
   - Copy the IP address returned by `NS lookup` and paste it into your web browser.
   - If the website does not load, the issue may be with DNS configuration.

4. **Inspect the Local Host File**:  
   - Your computer‚Äôs local host file might contain incorrect entries.
   - **Location**: Typically `/etc/hosts` on Linux.
   - Look for entries related to the domain (e.g., `www.google.com`) pointing to incorrect IP addresses.
   - **Example**: An entry `127.1.1.3` pointing to `www.google.com` can cause resolution issues.
   - Remove incorrect entries, save the file, and restart your browser.

5. **Restart and Test**:  
   - After updating the host file or DNS settings, restart your browser and attempt to access the domain again.
   - If correctly configured, the domain should resolve properly.

**Summary**  
Troubleshooting DNS resolution issues involves verifying network connectivity, checking DNS settings with `NS lookup`, testing direct IP addresses, and inspecting the local host file. By systematically isolating and addressing potential issues, you can effectively resolve problems related to domain name resolution. üõ†Ô∏èüí°
