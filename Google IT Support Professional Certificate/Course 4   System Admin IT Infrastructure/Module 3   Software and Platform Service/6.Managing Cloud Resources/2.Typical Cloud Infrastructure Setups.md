### Typical Cloud Infrastructure Setups ☁️🔧

#### Web Server Configuration 🌐

- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
  - **Role**: Serve the website to clients.
  - **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming requests evenly across multiple VMs to ensure balanced performance.
  - **Autoscaling**: Adjusts the number of VMs based on the volume of queries. Increases VMs during high demand and decreases them when demand drops.

- **Ephemeral Disks**:
  - **Description**: Local disks of VMs are temporary and disappear when VMs shut down.
  - **Data Persistence**: For permanent data, separate storage resources must be created and connected to the VMs.

- **Database Setup**:
  - **Description**: Databases are also cloud-based and served by multiple machines behind their own load balancer.
  - **Management**: Typically handled by the cloud provider, with the user not needing to manage the database infrastructure directly.

#### Monitoring and Alerting 📊🔔

- **Purpose**: Ensures smooth operation of services by detecting and correcting issues before they impact users.
- **Configuration**: Cloud providers usually offer built-in monitoring and alerting tools. Users can set up alerts based on performance metrics and thresholds.

#### Key Points 🗝️

- **Autoscaling**: Optimizes resource use and costs by dynamically adjusting the number of VMs.
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Temporary storage on VMs requires additional persistent storage solutions.
- **Managed Databases**: Simplifies database management by offloading it to the cloud provider.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Essential for proactive issue management and maintaining service quality.

This summary provides an overview of typical cloud infrastructure setups, highlighting the roles of VMs, autoscaling, ephemeral storage, managed databases, and monitoring tools. ☁️🖥️📈
