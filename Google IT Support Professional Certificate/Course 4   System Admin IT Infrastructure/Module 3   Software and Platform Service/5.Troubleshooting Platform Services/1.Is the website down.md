### Diagnosing Website Issues with HTTP Status Codes 🌐🔍

#### Overview 🛠️

- **Web Services and Breakages**: Web services can encounter various issues, requiring troubleshooting to resolve. HTTP status codes are essential tools for diagnosing these problems.

#### HTTP Status Codes 📈

- **Purpose**: HTTP status codes are numerical indicators sent by the server to the browser in response to a request. They provide information about the request's success or failure.
- **Common Codes**:
  - **404 Not Found**: Indicates that the requested URL does not exist on the server. For example, accessing `google.com/asdf` results in a 404 error if the URL is incorrect.
  - **4xx Errors**: These codes represent client-side issues. Common errors include:
    - **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to a client error.
    - **401 Unauthorized**: The client must authenticate to access the resource.
    - **403 Forbidden**: The client is authenticated but does not have permission to access the resource.
  - **5xx Errors**: These codes denote server-side issues. Common errors include:
    - **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition.
    - **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- **2xx Codes**: Indicate successful requests. For example, a 200 OK status means that the request was successful and the server returned the requested content.

#### Using Browser Tools for Diagnostics 🔍

- **Developer Tools**: Modern browsers like Chrome offer built-in tools for diagnosing HTTP issues.
  - **How to Access**:
    - Open Chrome Developer Tools by pressing `F12` or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect."
    - Navigate to the **Network** tab to view HTTP status codes and other network activity.
  - **Example**: By inspecting a failed request, you can see the status code and understand what went wrong.

#### Summary 📊

- **Diagnosing Issues**: HTTP status codes are crucial for identifying and troubleshooting web service problems. Understanding these codes helps in determining whether issues are client-side or server-side.
- **Tools and Techniques**: Using browser developer tools provides insights into HTTP responses and aids in effective troubleshooting.
