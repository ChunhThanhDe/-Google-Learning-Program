### Process Review for Dewgood 🌟💻

#### Current Challenges

1. **Ad Hoc Computer Purchases** 🛒
   - **Issue**: Computers are bought on the day an employee is hired due to budget constraints, causing delays and inefficiencies in onboarding.

2. **Single Server Dependency** 💻
   - **Issue**: All IT services (file storage, email, and website) are hosted on a single server, increasing the risk of service disruption and data loss.

3. **Manual Onboarding Process** 📝
   - **Issue**: New employees require manual setup for login, software installation, and file server access, consuming IT resources and delaying productivity.

4. **Inactive User Management** 🔒
   - **Issue**: Departing employees' accounts are not disabled in Windows Active Directory, posing security risks and management challenges.

5. **Ticketing System Issues** 🆘
   - **Issue**: The open-source ticketing system is confusing and difficult to use, leading employees to seek direct IT support for routine tasks.

#### Proposed Improvements

1. **Prepared Computer Stock** 📦
   - **Action**: Establish a small inventory of pre-configured computers for general use in collaboration with HR.
   - **Benefit**: Ensures timely equipment provision and reduces setup time upon hiring.

2. **Server Redundancy and Service Separation** ☁️
   - **Action**: Invest in additional servers or cloud services to separate email hosting and file storage.
   - **Benefit**: Minimizes service disruption and improves system reliability by reducing dependency on a single server.

3. **Automated Onboarding Process** ⚙️
   - **Action**: Implement automated scripts or deployment tools for onboarding. Standardize software installations and automate file server mappings.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces manual intervention, ensures consistency, and speeds up the onboarding process.

4. **Active Directory Management** 🔐
   - **Action**: Develop a process to promptly disable user accounts in Active Directory when an employee departs.
   - **Benefit**: Enhances security by preventing unauthorized access and streamlines user management.

5. **User-Friendly Ticketing System** 🎟️
   - **Action**: Evaluate and implement a more intuitive ticketing system or enhance the current one. Provide training or documentation to improve employee proficiency.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces support requests, improves usability, and allows IT to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine tasks.

#### Rationale

- **Efficiency and Productivity** 🚀: Stocking computers and automating onboarding processes reduce downtime and enable quicker employee productivity.
- **Reliability and Resilience** 🛡️: Server redundancy and service separation improve system reliability and protect against data loss.
- **Security and Compliance** 🔒: Effective Active Directory management enhances security and compliance, preventing unauthorized access.

By implementing these improvements, Dewgood can enhance operational efficiency, data security, and user satisfaction, effectively supporting their mission as a non-profit organization.
