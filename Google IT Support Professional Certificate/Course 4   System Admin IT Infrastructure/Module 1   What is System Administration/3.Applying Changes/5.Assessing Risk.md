# Assessing Risk in Change Management ⚠️🔍

## Importance of Risk Assessment 📊

- **Purpose**: Determine the appropriate level of effort and resources required for testing and implementing changes based on the risk involved.

## Factors to Consider 🧩

1. **Service Criticality** 🔑
   - **Mission-Critical Services**: Essential for operations (e.g., centralized authentication systems, billing systems, backup systems).
   - **Non-Critical Services**: Less impact if disrupted (e.g., informational websites, internal ticket systems).

2. **User Impact** 🌐
   - **High Impact**: Services with a large number of users or critical functions require more rigorous testing and backup plans.
   - **Low Impact**: Services affecting fewer users or less critical functions may need less intensive measures.

## Investment in Testing and Reversion 🛠️

- **Test Instances**: Always use a test environment to validate changes.
- **Backup Plans**: Have a rollback or reversion plan in place.

## Service Availability Agreements 📅

- **User Agreements**: Companies often schedule disruptive maintenance during low-impact times (e.g., weekends) as agreed upon with users.
- **Priority Setting**: Address issues that critically affect work higher than minor issues that are less disruptive.

## Summary 📋

1. **Evaluate Service Importance**: Assess whether the service is mission-critical or less significant.
2. **Determine User Impact**: Consider how many users are affected and prioritize accordingly.
3. **Allocate Resources Wisely**: Invest time and effort in testing and rollback plans based on the service's criticality and impact.
4. **Adhere to Agreements**: Follow user agreements for maintenance windows and set priorities based on service impact.
