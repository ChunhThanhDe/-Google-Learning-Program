## 📝 Being Your Best Self for the Interview

Being your best self for the interview starts the night before. Being fully rested will help you have more energy, be more focused, and minimize anxiety. So make sure that you get a good night's sleep. 

### 😴 Rest and Relaxation

Don't try to cram in any last-minute studying, as this will only make you more anxious. Instead, try to relax and go to bed early. 

### 🍳 Proper Breakfast

On the day of the interview, eat a proper breakfast. It's never a good idea to be hungry during an interview. 

### ⏰ Time Management

Aim to arrive earlier than the scheduled time and give yourself enough travel time for any mishaps along the way. 

### 💼 Preparing for the Interview

Make sure you're comfortable before you begin the actual interview. Don't be afraid to ask for something if you need it. Use the restroom, grab a glass of water, and ask for a notepad and pen for notes or to illustrate answers when necessary. 

### 👀 Being Fully Present

Be fully present for the duration of the interview. This means turning off your phone to avoid interruptions and giving the interviewer your full attention. Use those active listening skills that you've practiced. Make eye contact, nod, indicate understanding, and ask follow-up questions. 

### 🌟 Letting Your Personality Shine

Don't forget to be yourself. You want the interviewer to remember you, so let your personality show. Make sure to highlight what makes you unique. 

### 🤔 Asking Questions

Remember that the interview is also an opportunity for you to ask questions about the things that you care about. You're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you. Find out if this is a company that you want to work for and whether you'll be able to achieve your career goals there. 

### 🧘‍♀️ Taking Your Time

Finally, remember to slow down. Most people start talking faster and faster when they're nervous, so be aware of your pace. If you notice that you're getting nervous, pause for a moment to take a few deep breaths, and then consciously slow down.
