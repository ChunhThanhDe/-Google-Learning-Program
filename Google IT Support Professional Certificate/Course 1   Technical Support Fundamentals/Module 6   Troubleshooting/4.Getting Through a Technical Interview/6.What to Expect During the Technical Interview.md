## üìù When You're Interviewing

When you're interviewing for a technical position, you'll likely have one or more interviews where you'll specifically need to demonstrate your technical skills and knowledge. These interviews may take the form of technical troubleshooting scenarios or explanations of technical concepts and subjects. 

### üéØ Solid Foundation and Pushing Limits

As we've said, you want to have a solid foundation for all the fundamental concepts. A good interviewer will push you to the limits of your knowledge. This means it's very likely that during an interview, you'll reach a point where you're not sure you know the right answer‚Äîthis is expected. But you shouldn't just say, "I don't know." If you were supporting a user, you wouldn't say it then either. It's okay to admit you're not sure, but you should then explain what you would do to find the answer.

### üß© Problem-Solving Strategy

As an IT support specialist, you should expect to often face new and unfamiliar problems. Having a good problem-solving strategy is more important than knowing all the answers. If the question you're answering is big and complex, outline how you'd break down the work needed to solve the problem before going into the exact details of what needs to be done. If you're thinking about what the best solution could be, share your train of thought with your interviewer so they can follow along. Thinking aloud not only helps the interviewer see your thought process, but it also helps you work through the problem.

### üó£Ô∏è Explaining Concepts and Asking Follow-Up Questions

When you mention concepts or technologies, you should be ready to explain them and articulate why you might choose one thing over another. For instance, if you're working through a networking problem and say something like, "the problem might be related to the DNS settings," be ready to explain what DNS is and why it relates to the issue. You should also clarify the question's constraints. Don't assume anything‚Äîit's okay and even expected to ask the interviewer follow-up questions to ensure that the problem is correctly framed. Always use the data and evidence you have from the interviewer to inform your next steps.

### üìù Taking Notes and Using Diagrams

If the question is very complex, it might become difficult to follow or explain the solution. In this case, it's useful to take notes and use diagrams to illustrate the problem. You can use this process when it makes sense. It doesn't mean you need to write everything down during an interview. Sometimes the answer is straightforward, and you can just go ahead and explain it without writing anything down.

_That's it! Keep these tips in mind to showcase your technical skills effectively during interviews. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. üòä_
