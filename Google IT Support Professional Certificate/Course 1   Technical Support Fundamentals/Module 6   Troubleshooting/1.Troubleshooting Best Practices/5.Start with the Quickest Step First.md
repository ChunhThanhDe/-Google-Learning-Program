# Fixing the Issue: Start with the Quickest Step First

üîß **Understanding the Problem**

We've already asked insightful questions to gain a better understanding of the problem. We've narrowed it down to a specific area and examined our cookie crumbs. Now, it's time to focus on resolving the issue.

üéØ **Isolating the Root Cause**

When troubleshooting an issue, there may not always be a single correct solution. The goal is to isolate the problem to its root cause. To achieve this, you need to try various remediation steps. If a step doesn't work, you can eliminate it as the cause.

‚è© **Starting with the Quickest Step**

Now, let's explore the "Start with the quickest step first" method. The objective is to efficiently identify the root cause. When you have multiple options to isolate an issue, how do you determine which option to try first? It's straightforward‚Äîbegin with the fastest option.

‚ú® **Example Scenario**

User: I'm experiencing a strange issue with my software. When I launch it, nothing happens, even though I just installed it.

Support: Interesting. It's possible that the installation got corrupted. Let's try reinstalling it.

User: I reinstalled it, but the issue persists.

Support: Do you remember if you restarted your computer after the installation?

User: Oh, I didn't restart it. Let me try that. 

User: It works now!

In this scenario, both reinstalling the software and restarting the computer could potentially resolve the issue. However, since a restart can be tested more quickly than a reinstall, it makes sense to try the restart first.
