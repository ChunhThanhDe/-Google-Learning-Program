# Introduction to Computer Software

## About Me
👋 Hi! I'm excited to guide you through the world of computer software. My passion for technology began in high school, where I experienced firsthand how technology connects people and opens up opportunities, especially in a remote setting. This initial interest led me to enlist in the US Navy as an Information Systems Technician, where I maintained computer and network systems. Throughout my journey, I’ve seen how technology can unite people, whether during training exercises or connecting families through video chat.

## The Power of Technology
💡 Many people use technology daily, but few truly understand its inner workings. A career in IT can be challenging but incredibly rewarding. For instance, recovering irreplaceable family photos from a failing hard drive can be a deeply satisfying experience. As an IT support specialist, you'll have the knowledge to fix problems and ensure smooth communication between people, which is pretty cool!

## Introduction to Software
🖥️ In this course, we’ll explore the third layer of computer architecture: software. Software allows us to interact with our computers and includes everything from operating systems to applications we use every day. While hardware consists of physical components, software refers to the intangible instructions that guide the hardware's actions.

## What's Next?
🔍 In the next lesson, we’ll dive deeper into what software is, how we install it, and how it operates.

Stay tuned for an exciting journey into the world of computer software! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. 😊
