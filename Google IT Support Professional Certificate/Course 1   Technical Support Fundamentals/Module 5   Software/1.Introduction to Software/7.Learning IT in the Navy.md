# My Journey in Information Technology

ðŸŽµ **Introduction**

In high school, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do yet. However, when I joined the US Navy, I discovered the exciting world of information technology (IT). As an information systems technician, I had the opportunity to be resourceful and innovative, especially during deployments in challenging environments.

ðŸ’¡ **Resourcefulness in the Navy**

Being out in the desert during deployments required me to utilize the tools available to get the job done. I vividly remember being in a server room inside a tent, with sand blowing in. We had to take out the servers occasionally and use a reverse vacuum to blow the dust and sand out, ensuring their continued operation. It was a testament to the resourcefulness and adaptability required in such circumstances.

ðŸš€ **My First Programming Experience**

One of my favorite technology moments in the Navy was when a command came down, requiring a specific task to be performed. I was tasked with writing a program to accomplish it, despite never having written one before. I took on the challenge, conducting research, learning, and figuring out the necessary steps. Eventually, I successfully wrote the program, ran it, and witnessed it perform the desired action. It was an incredibly satisfying experience. I had created something out of nothing, and it worked flawlessly.

ðŸ”Š **Conclusion**

That moment of successfully writing and running my first program in the Navy was truly amazing. It sparked a deep sense of fulfillment and excitement within me. From that point forward, I knew that working with technology and programming was something I wanted to pursue further.
