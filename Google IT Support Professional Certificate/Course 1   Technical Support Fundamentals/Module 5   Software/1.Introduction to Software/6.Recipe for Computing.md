# Evolution of Programming Languages

📚 **Introduction**

Remember that in the 1950s, computer scientists used punch cards to store programs. These punch cards represented bits that the CPU would read and then perform a series of instructions based on what the program was. Storing programs on punch cards was a long and tedious task, requiring stacks and stacks of cards. Computer scientists needed a better way to send instructions to a machine.

🃏 **Assembly Language**

Eventually, assembly language was invented, which allowed computer scientists to use human-readable instructions assembled into code that machines could understand. Assembly language used machine instructions, such as taking integers from registers, performing mathematical operations, and storing output data. While a step up from punch cards, assembly language was still a thin veil from machine code. It didn't allow programmers to use real human words to build a program, and programs written for a specific CPU could only run on that CPU or its family.

🔧 **Compiled Programming Languages**

To address these limitations, compiled programming languages were developed. These languages used human-readable instructions and were processed through a compiler. The compiler translated the human instructions into machine instructions. Compilers, like the one invented by Admiral Grace Hopper, played a key role in making programming easier and paved the way for modern computing. With compilers, programmers could write code in a high-level language like the example shown, and it would be translated into machine code.

🚀 **Abstraction and Interpreted Languages**

As computer science progressed, the need for more abstraction and flexibility arose. Hundreds of programming languages were developed to abstract the different CPU instructions into simpler commands. Alongside compiled languages, interpreted languages emerged. These languages were not compiled ahead-of-time. Instead, the code written in these languages was usually called a script and was run by an interpreter. The interpreter interpreted the code into CPU instructions just in time to execute them.

💻 **Scripting Languages and IT Support**

As an IT support specialist, you'll learn how to write code using a scripting language. Scripting can help you harness the power of a computer to perform tasks on your behalf, simplifying problem-solving and enabling efficient task automation. Programming languages, whether compiled or interpreted, are used to create programs that perform specific tasks or multiple tasks.

🌟 **Conclusion**

The evolution of programming languages, from punch cards to compiled and interpreted languages, has made programming more accessible and powerful. Programming languages have gone from machine-specific instructions to human-readable languages, enabling programmers to write code that can run on various hardware configurations. The use of scripting languages in IT support allows for automation and efficient task execution.
