## Pioneers in Computing and IT

Computer technology has come a long way since the first computer was invented. Along the way, many people from diverse backgrounds contributed inventions and innovations that helped us get to where we are today with modern computers. Without these individuals, information technology would not be where it is today.

**Early Computer Pioneers**

**Ada Lovelace** was a remarkable pioneer in the field of computing. She was born in 1815 to Anna Milbanke and the poet Lord Byron. 🎩 Her mother Anna Milbanke educated her to excel in mathematics. When Lovelace was still young, she was shown the Difference Engine (a mechanical calculator developed by Charles Babbage) and published a set of notes which contained the first computer algorithm for the Analytical Engine in 1843. Lovelace predicted at the time that computers would eventually be used outside of mathematics for things like composing music and made predictions about how technology would influence society. 🎵💻

**Alan Turing** was a brilliant mathematician and computer scientist. He was born in 1912. While completing his degrees, he developed the concept of the Turing machine. Turing proved that there were some yes/no mathematical questions that could never be solved computationally, which defined computation and its limitations. These findings would go on to become one of the seeds of computer science. His conceptual Turing machine (so named by his doctoral advisor) is considered a predecessor of modern computer programs. During the Second World War, Turing developed the Turing-Welchman Bombe, which was used to decipher Nazi codes and intercept enemy messages. After the war, Turing's Imitation Game (now known as the Turing test) was created as a means to evaluate the abilities of artificial intelligence. 🧮🔐🤖

**Margaret Hamilton** made significant contributions to the field of software engineering. She was born in 1936. While working in the meteorology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she developed software for predicting weather. Later, Hamilton would go on to work on the software that was used in the NASA Apollo command and lunar modules. With her experience writing software, she wanted to ensure that this skill would get its due respect and coined the term "software engineering." Culminating her experience working on the Apollo missions and moon landings, Hamilton formalized what she learned into a theory that would later become the Universal System Language. 🌩️🚀💻

**Admiral Grace Hopper** was a pioneering computer scientist and naval officer. She was born in 1906. During the Second World War, she joined the US Navy Reserve after taking a leave from her role as a mathematics professor at Vassar College. In the Navy, she was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University, where she worked on the programming team for the Mark I computer. After the war and her time at Harvard, she began working on more powerful computers and recommended that a programming language be developed that used English words rather than symbols. This concept would eventually become FLOW-MATIC, the first programming language to use English words, which also necessitated the invention of the first compiler (a program that translates source code into machine code). Notably, she is also credited with first using the term "computer bug" after a real bug (a moth) flew into a computer she was working on. Later in her career, she was one of the designers of COBOL, a programming language that is still in use today. ⚓🐛💻

## NASA and the Human Computers

🧮 The following women all worked on various NASA projects. Some even were hired as human computers. They were tasked with completing complex calculations by hand for all sorts of situations from wartime thrust-to-weight ratios to Apollo orbit trajectories. They all went on to have impressive careers in mathematics and computer science.
- Annie Easley developed the energy analytics code used to analyze power technology, including the technology that was used in battery technology for Centaur rockets and early hybrid vehicles. 👩‍🔬🚀🔋

- Katherine Johnson was a physicist, mathematician, and space scientist who provided the calculations for important missions like the first orbit of the Earth and the Apollo 11 moon landing. 👩‍🚀🌍🚀

- Dorothy was a mathematician who would eventually become the first African American supervisor of NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics which would later become NASA) and a FORTRAN expert programmer working on the Scout Launch Vehicle Program (a family of rockets that placed small satellites in orbit).👩🏾‍💼💻🚀

- Mary Jackson was NASA’s first Black female engineer. She worked on wind tunnel and flight experiments and would go on to earn NASA’s most senior engineering title. 🙌💡💻

- Melba Roy Mouton was a Head Mathematician at NASA working on Project Echo, the first experiment in passive satellite communication. At NASA, she wrote programs that calculated locations and trajectories of aircraft. 🚀🔋👩‍🚀

- Evelyn Boyd Granville worked on multiple projects in the Apollo and Mercury programs for NASA. She worked on computer techniques related to concepts like celestial mechanics and trajectory computation. 💻🔐🤖

## Innovators in Modern Technology

The world of modern technology has seen the rise of many innovators who have made significant contributions to various fields. Here are a few notable examples:
