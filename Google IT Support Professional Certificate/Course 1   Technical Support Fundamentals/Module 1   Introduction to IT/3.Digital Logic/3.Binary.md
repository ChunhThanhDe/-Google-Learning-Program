## Binary

### 🤔 **Introduction** 

In this section, we'll explore how computers represent information using binary code (ones and zeros). We'll start by understanding the basic concept of binary representation and its historical roots in punch cards.

### 💡 **Binary Representation with Light Bulbs**

To grasp the concept of binary, imagine a light bulb and a switch. When the light is on, we represent it as one; when it's off, we represent it as zero. By extending this idea to a group of eight light bulbs and switches (eight bits), we can represent larger numbers using combinations of ones and zeros.

### 🃏 **Punch Cards and Binary**

Drawing inspiration from Jacquard's loom, early computers used punch cards with holes to represent ones and zeros. A hole indicated one, while its absence denoted zero. This binary representation allowed intricate patterns to be woven into fabric using the loom.

### 🔌 **Binary Representation with Transistors**

Modern computers utilize transistors to represent binary code. Instead of punch cards, the presence or absence of an electric voltage is used. If there's a voltage, it's represented as one; if not, it's represented as zero. Transistors enable the passage of electrical signals, forming the foundation of binary representation in today's computers.

### ⚙️ **Logic Gates and Complex Tasks**

To perform complex tasks, transistors are combined with logic gates. Logic gates allow computers to make decisions and route electrical signals based on logical conditions. While there are various types of logic gates, their detailed explanation is beyond the scope of this section.

### 👩‍💻 **Binary to Human-Readable Instructions**

Later in the course, we'll explore how human-readable instructions are translated into binary code using compilers. This fundamental concept forms the basis of programming and has led to the creation of social media, video games, and many other technologies we enjoy today.
