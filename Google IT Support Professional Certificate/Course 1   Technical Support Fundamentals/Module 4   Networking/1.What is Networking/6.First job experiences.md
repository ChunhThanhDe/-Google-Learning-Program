# Journey in IT 🎵

## Glorified Spam Filter 📩

First IT job was essentially a glorified spam filter. Hired part-time to go through the spam folder and find anything mislabeled as spam, then forward those messages to people's inboxes. After about a week, it became clear how absurd it was for companies to pay someone to perform this mundane task.

## Automating the Process 🤖

Determined to find a better solution, discovered **SpamAssassin**, an open-source mail filter. Installed it and automated the entire spam filtering process. Excited about the outcome, approached the boss and explained that manual intervention was no longer necessary. This breakthrough eliminated the need to continue with the spam filtering task.

## Expanding Responsibilities 💼

With newfound time and freedom, started exploring other areas of IT. Created new accounts that would delete old accounts, streamlining the system further. Took on various tasks and responsibilities, gradually evolving into the role of a full-time system administrator for the company.

## Pursuing Opportunities at Google 🌟

As graduation approached, began considering opportunities at large companies, with Google standing out as an exciting prospect. Hastily put together a resume and applied for an IT position, despite low expectations of landing the job.

## A Surprising Turn of Events 🏢

To my astonishment, while moving to Seattle, received a message from Google asking if I could start in four weeks. It was a moment of decision-making and quick adjustments. Within that limited timeframe, had to completely change plans to seize this unexpected opportunity.

## Embracing IT in a Massive Environment 🌐

Starting at Google exposed me to the magnitude and complexity of working in IT within a massive organization. It was an invaluable experience that deepened the understanding of what IT truly entails in such a vast environment.
