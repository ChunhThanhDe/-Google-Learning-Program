# My Journey in IT 🎵

## Glorified Spam Filter 📩

My first IT job was essentially a glorified spam filter. They hired me part-time to go through the spam folder and find anything that got mislabeled as spam. I would then forward those messages to people's inboxes. After doing this for about a week, I realized how insane it was that huge companies were paying people to sit in the back of a room and perform this mundane task.

## Automating the Process 🤖

Determined to find a better solution, I discovered **SpamAssassin**, an open-source mail filter. I installed SpamAssassin and automated the entire spam filtering process. Excited about the outcome, I approached my boss and explained that we no longer needed manual intervention. This breakthrough eliminated the need for me to continue with the spam filtering task.

## Expanding Responsibilities 💼

With my newfound time and freedom, I started exploring other areas of IT. One of the things I did was create new accounts that would delete old accounts, streamlining the system further. I took on various tasks and responsibilities, gradually evolving into the role of a full-time system administrator for the company.

## Pursuing Opportunities at Google 🌟

As I graduated, I began considering opportunities at other large companies. Google stood out as an exciting prospect. Without hesitation, I hastily put together my resume and applied for an IT position with them. Although I didn't have high expectations of getting the job, I took a chance and submitted my application.

## A Surprising Turn of Events 🏢

To my astonishment, while in the midst of moving to Seattle, I received a message from Google. They asked if I could start in four weeks. It was a moment of decision-making and quick adjustments. Within that limited timeframe, I had to completely change my plans to seize this unexpected opportunity.

## Embracing IT in a Massive Environment 🌐

Starting at Google exposed me to the magnitude and complexity of working in IT within a massive organization. It was an invaluable experience that allowed me to deepen my understanding of what IT truly entailed in such a vast environment.
