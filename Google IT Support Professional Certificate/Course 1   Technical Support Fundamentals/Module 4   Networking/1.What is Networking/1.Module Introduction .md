## Introduction network 👋

👋 Hi, my name is Victor Escobedo, and I'm a corporate operations engineer. I'm thrilled to spend the next few lessons with you before my colleague and friend Jeon takes over and wraps up the remaining lessons on the internet. But before we dive in, let me share a little bit about myself.

### Early Passion for IT

🔍 My passion for IT started when I was just nine years old. It all began when my dad brought home our first computer. As a mechanical engineer, he used the computer for his CAD work. This was my first exposure to computers, and I soon discovered the ability to install new software, including computer games. Through tinkering with the computer, I became more and more fascinated by how it worked. I even ventured to open up the case and explore its inner components, learning through trial and error.

🌱 These early experiences planted the seeds that inspired my career in IT. However, in the environment where I grew up, pursuing higher education and a career in technology wasn't a common topic of discussion or encouragement. As a first-generation Mexican American, I didn't have many examples of people around me pursuing tech careers. Most of my friends and family were primarily focused on completing high school and finding jobs, without much consideration for long-term careers.

🎓 Limited Resources and College Journey

🚧 My school lacked the resources to offer extensive technical classes, and while my father worked in mechanical engineering, computers were tools to him, like a mill, ruler, or hammer. Despite this, my parents encouraged me to work hard and pursue my interest in computers, even though they couldn't provide guidance on college or a career in tech due to their own lack of experience.

🎓 When I decided to attend college, I chose to study computer science because it aligned with my curiosity about how computers function at a fundamental level. I soon realized that this foundational knowledge was crucial in understanding higher-level concepts relevant to a career in technology.

💼 IT Career Journey

👨‍💻 While in college, I took on my first IT job at a local small company. Over the past 12 years, I've been working in IT, with the last 7 years spent here at Google. Currently, my role involves managing the deployment of large internal IT projects for the company. Drawing from my years of experience, including my initial IT helpdesk roles, I ensure that I understand the impact of these projects on our users and various support teams.

## The Internet and Its Impact

🌐 Now that you know a little bit about me, let's delve into the internet. The internet has revolutionized our ability to connect with people worldwide. In the past, we relied on paper maps and step-by-step directions to navigate, phone calls to keep up with friends, and library visits to learn new things. Discovering new restaurants depended on word-of-mouth or advertisements, without the convenience of platforms like Yelp that rate and review establishments.

🌍 For many of us, life without the internet seems unimaginable. It has become an integral part of our lives, transforming the way we communicate, gather information, and experience the world. In the upcoming lessons, you will learn about the internet's definition, its origins, and its profound impact on both positive and negative aspects of our lives.

📚 Stay tuned for an exciting exploration of the internet!
