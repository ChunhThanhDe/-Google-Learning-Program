# The Internet: Its Creation and Evolution üåê

## Introduction and Background üìö

Before diving into the history and significance of the Internet, this section introduces the author. The author is a Program Manager in Android Security, responsible for managing new security features for each version of Android, which helps protect over two billion users. With a passion for technology from a young age, the author began working in IT at the age of 16. During university, free time was spent reading about new tech and building servers from old computer parts. Fond memories include late-night browsing sessions on dial-up Internet, quietly exploring websites and absorbing random tech knowledge.

## Early IT Journey and Non-Profit Work üñ•Ô∏è

The author's first jobs were as a one-person IT crew at three non-profit organizations. It was both stressful and exciting to be responsible for everything, from configuring and administering backup servers to providing guidance on email access and computer usage for new employees. Despite not being a great test taker, the author believed that hard work and perseverance would pave the way for a successful IT career. The author is thrilled to share experiences and help others embark on their IT journey.

## Importance of the Internet üíª

The Internet has become an integral part of life, encompassing banking, entertainment, news, and education. Understanding the significance of the Internet is crucial, especially as some original designs have reached their limitations. For IT support specialists, comprehending the future of the Internet and its evolution is essential.

## The Birth of the Internet üï∞Ô∏è

Journey back to the 1950s, where it all began. Computers were massive and bulky. If you were a programmer, interacting directly with these colossal machines became tiresome, especially when multiple users wanted to access the only available computing resource. In the late 1960s, the US government initiated a project called DARPA, leading to the creation of ARPANET, the earliest version of the Internet. This development allowed programmers to remotely access shared computing resources, but a significant hurdle remained‚Äînetworks couldn't communicate with each other.

## The TCP/IP Breakthrough üåê

In the 1970s, a critical breakthrough occurred in computer networking. Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Initially, only a few computers in universities, governments, and businesses adopted TCP/IP. However, over 50 years, billions of computers have implemented this protocol, enabling global data transmission. TCP/IP became the foundation of the modern Internet, allowing people worldwide to send data to one another.

## The Birth of the World Wide Web üåç

While TCP/IP enabled data transfer, the exchanged information was predominantly plain text and lacked centralization. In the 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, utilizing different protocols to display information in webpages. This invention quickly became the primary method for communication and accessing the Internet, allowing anyone with an Internet connection to access vast information.

## The Internet Today and its Impact üì≤

Thirty years have passed since the creation of the World Wide Web. We have progressed from simple email messages and basic web pages to engaging in video chats, receiving instant news updates, and conducting online transactions within seconds. The Internet has transformed our lives, enabling us to order food, purchase books, cars, and participate in online courses. The Internet as we know it today is the result of the collective knowledge and engineering efforts of numerous brilliant scientists and organizations.
