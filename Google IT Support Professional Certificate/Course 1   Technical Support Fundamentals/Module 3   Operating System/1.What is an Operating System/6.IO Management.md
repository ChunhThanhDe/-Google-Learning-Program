# Input and Output Management

🖥️ The kernel not only manages files, processes, and memory but also handles **Input and Output (I/O) management** for devices like monitors, keyboards, mice, hard drives, and network adapters.

## Device Management

🔌 The kernel manages I/O devices by loading **drivers** that allow communication between the operating system and hardware. It facilitates data transfer and ensures efficient communication between devices.

💬 I/O management includes both user-device communication and **inter-device communication**. The kernel oversees this process to ensure **efficient, error-free** data transfer.

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

🔧 **Hardware resource issues** are often the cause of slow system performance:
- **Insufficient RAM** can prevent multiple processes from loading.
- **CPU shortages** can slow down program execution.
- **Excessive I/O** can block other data transmissions, leading to sluggishness.

⏱️ **Slow performance** is a common issue in IT support, and identifying its source—whether due to memory, CPU, or I/O overload—is key to resolving it.
