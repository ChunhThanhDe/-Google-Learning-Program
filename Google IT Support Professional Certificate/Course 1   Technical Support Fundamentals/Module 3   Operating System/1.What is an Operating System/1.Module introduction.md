## My Journey into Tech 🚀

### Early Exposure
The first time I interacted with computers was in **middle school** when my teacher introduced us to fun video and multimedia projects. At home, my brother introduced me to technology.

### Family Background
My parents were immigrants from Vietnam, and we didn’t have a lot of money growing up. We had to be **resourceful** to get a computer at home. I remember spending hours with my brother while he assembled a computer, constantly asking him questions.

### Building My Own Computer
Eventually, I wanted to build my own computer:

- I gathered old parts and saved money for new components.
- Tried assembling everything based on what I learned from my brother.
- It **didn’t work**—I had used incompatible parts.

After a lot of trial and error, troubleshooting, and long search sessions on the Internet, I finally got it working. Hearing my computer boot up for the first time was an amazing feeling! 🎉

### Realizing My Passion
Once I got to **college**, I took a job as an IT support specialist to help pay for tuition. That’s when I realized that tech was something I could pursue as a career. I love the intense concentration and problem-solving required in IT.

- Figuring out why an application won’t start.
- Troubleshooting issues with graphics in games.
- Resolving any other system-related problems.

Things can get messy, but that’s what makes it **exciting**!
