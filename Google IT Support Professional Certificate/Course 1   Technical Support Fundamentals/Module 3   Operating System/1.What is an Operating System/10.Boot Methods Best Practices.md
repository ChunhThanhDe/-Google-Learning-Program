# Boot Methods Best Practices

## üí° Introduction

The most common way to boot a computer is by pressing the power button and allowing the normal startup process to run. However, sometimes this process fails, or you may need to boot with a different operating system. In such cases, alternative boot methods can be used. This guide covers the various methods you can use to boot a computer.

## üîÄ The Boot Process

When a computer is powered on, the BIOS/UEFI (Basic Input/Output System or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) runs diagnostic tests to ensure proper hardware functioning. The **BIOS** initializes the hardware and determines the **boot order**. This boot order is a sequence that tells the system which devices to check for a bootloader‚Äîa small program that initiates the operating system loading process.

## üìÇ Configuring Boot Options

To modify the boot order and choose a boot method, you need to access the **BIOS**:

- **On Windows or Linux**: Power on the system and look for an on-screen message indicating the key to press for entering BIOS setup (e.g., "Press DEL to enter SETUP," "F2=SETUP," or "Press F12 to enter SETUP").
  
- **On macOS**: Press and hold the **Option key** during startup to access the **Startup Manager**, which scans for bootable devices.

Once in the BIOS, the **Boot Options** menu will display a list of devices where a bootloader might be found, such as hard drives, USB drives, optical drives, or network sources. You can set the order in which the system checks these devices for bootloaders.

## üî¢ Boot Method Options

Below are the different boot methods available in most BIOS configurations:

### üìü External Boot Methods:

- **USB Drive**: Boot from a USB stick containing an operating system or necessary boot resources.
- **Optical Media**: Boot from a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disk inserted in the computer's optical drive.
- **Solid State Boot Drive (SSD)**: Boot from an SSD for faster startup, as SSDs have no moving parts.
- **External Hot-Swappable Drive**: Boot from an external hard drive that can be connected and disconnected without powering off the system.
- **Network Boot**: Boot directly from a local area network (LAN) using the **Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)**, which allows loading an OS without a local storage device.

### üåê Internet-Based Boot Methods:

- **Remote Access**: Booting from a remote location via technologies like **IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface)**, often used in server environments.
- **Wake on LAN (WoL)**: Booting the computer remotely using **Wake on LAN**, which allows the system to power on when a network message is received.

### üì• Internal Boot Methods:

- **Disk Partitions**: Boot from different partitions on the same drive, allowing for **dual booting** multiple operating systems on a single machine.

## üí° Key Takeaways

- There are multiple methods to boot a computer, from **USB drives** and **optical media** to **network** and **internet-based booting**.
- **Dual booting** allows running multiple operating systems by partitioning the internal drive.
- Configuring the **boot order** in the BIOS is key to choosing the right boot method.
