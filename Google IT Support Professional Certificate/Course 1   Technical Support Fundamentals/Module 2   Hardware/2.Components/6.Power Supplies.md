# Introduction

To get our computer up and running, we need to provide it with power. Computers rely on a power supply to convert the electricity from the wall outlet into a usable form. There are two types of electricity: 

- Direct Current (DC): Flows in one direction.
- Alternating Current (AC): Changes direction constantly.

Since computers operate on DC voltage, we need a power supply to convert the AC voltage from the power company into low voltage DC power that can be used throughout the computer.

## Power Supplies

A power supply unit (PSU) is responsible for converting AC voltage to DC voltage. It is typically equipped with a fan for cooling and displays voltage information. Power supplies also come with cables to power the motherboard and other components.

## Understanding Electricity ⚡💡

To understand electricity, let's draw an analogy with water pipes. Imagine our tanks have a faucet connected to a pressurized water tank. When we turn on the faucet, water flows out. Similarly, when we plug an appliance into a wall outlet and turn it on, electricity flows.The pressure in our water tank is equivalent to voltage in electricity. If we increase the pressure, more water flows out. In electricity, we refer to this pressure as voltage.

## Voltage and Device Compatibility ⚡🔌💻

Using an incorrect voltage can damage electronic devices. If a device designed for 120 volts is plugged into a 220-volt outlet, the higher voltage can cause the device to malfunction or even fry its components. However, if a device designed for 220 volts is plugged into a 120-volt outlet, it may still function, albeit at a slower pace.It is crucial to use the proper voltage for your electronics to avoid damage and ensure optimal performance.

## Current and Amperage ⚡🔌🔋

The amount of electricity flowing through a device is measured in amps, referred to as current or amperage. Amps determine how much electricity the device pulls, while voltage supplies the electricity. Consider the back of your device charger, where you may see something like "1A" or "2.1A." Charging a device with a 2.1-amp charger will be faster than using a 1-amp charger because it can provide a higher current.

## Wattage ⚡💡🔌

Wattage indicates the total amount of power a device needs, combining voltage and amperage. If your power supply has insufficient wattage, you won't be able to power your computer effectively. It's important to ensure that your power supply provides enough wattage for your system.Having a power supply with higher wattage than necessary won't overpower your computer. Power supplies only provide the amount of power that your system needs. It's generally recommended to have a slightly larger power supply to accommodate any future upgrades or higher power demands.💡⚠️ 

However, a bad power supply can cause various issues. The computer may not turn on at all, and power supplies can fail due to reasons like burnouts, power surges, or lightning strikes. It's essential to know how to diagnose power issues and replace a failed power supply, especially for IT support specialists.🛠️🔌💡
