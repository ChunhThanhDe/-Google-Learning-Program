## The Power of CPUs in Computing 💻🧠🔌

If someone asked you to calculate the square root of 5,000,439,493, would you do the math by hand? 🧮💡 Unless you enjoy tediously solving math problems, you'd probably opt for a calculator. Similarly, when it comes to binary calculations, manual computation is impractical. Fortunately, your computer houses a powerful built-in calculator—the CPU (Central Processing Unit). 🖥️🔢

In a previous lesson, we discussed the CPU's role in detail. Do you remember? The CPU functions as the brain of our computer, utilizing a translation book called an instruction set to process and execute operations on our data. This instruction set comprises a list of commands that the CPU can perform, such as addition, subtraction, and data manipulation. 📚🧩

Every program on your computer, despite its complexity, is ultimately composed of small and straightforward instructions found within the instruction set. These instruction sets are hard-coded into the CPU, and different CPU manufacturers may employ different sets. However, they generally perform the same functions. It's akin to how car manufacturers build engines differently but still achieve the same objective. 🚗🔧

As an IT support specialist, you've likely dealt with computer hardware, such as replacing failed hard disks, upgrading RAM modules, and installing video cards. Familiarizing yourself with the available options is crucial. You may have heard of popular CPU manufacturers or chipsets like Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm. Each manufacturer utilizes distinct product names to differentiate their processors, such as Intel Core i7, AMD Athlon, Snapdragon 810, Apple A8, and more. Now, when you encounter these terms, you'll understand their meaning. 💡🔌

Remember that each CPU manufacturer has its own strengths and weaknesses. If you're interested in delving deeper into why certain CPUs enjoy greater popularity than others, you can explore the supplemental reading provided. When selecting a CPU, compatibility with your motherboard—a circuit board connecting all components—is essential. Beware! You can't simply purchase a collection of parts and expect them to seamlessly function together. CPUs come in different socket types that correspond to specific motherboard designs. Some CPUs feature small pins protruding outward, while others have contact points resembling dots. It's crucial to ensure that your chosen CPU fits correctly into the designated socket on your motherboard. Currently, two major CPU socket types are prevalent: Land Grid Array (LGA) and Pin Grid Array (PGA). LGA sockets include pins extending from the motherboard, and their sizes may vary, so always verify compatibility beforehand. The type of socket is often indicated on the box when purchasing a CPU or motherboard. If the information is unavailable, you can consult the manufacturer's website, which typically lists compatible CPU models. The other socket type, PGA, has pins located directly on the processor itself. 💻🔌

When installing a CPU, several measures must be taken to maintain its optimal temperature. Due to the intensive workload they handle, CPUs are prone to overheating. Therefore, it's necessary to incorporate a heat sink, which absorbs heat from the CPU and dissipates it through a fan or another cooling medium. 🌡️❄️

One final aspect to note about CPUs is their architecture, denoted as either 32-bit or 64-bit. What does this mean? Well, just as we can process eight bits in binary, CPUs with 32-bit or 64-bit architecture indicate their efficiency in handling larger amounts of data. For now, the key takeaway is that the CPU plays a vital role in computing, so it's crucial to ensure compatibility with other components and optimal performance to meet your computing needs. 💪💻🔌

## The Significance of RAM in Computing 💾🧠💡

Let's talk about RAM, our computer's short-term memory. We use RAM to store data that we want to access quickly. This data changes all the time, so it isn't permanent. Almost all RAM is volatile, which means that once we power off our machines, the data stored in RAM is cleared. Remember that our computer is comprised of programs. To run a program, we need to make a copy of it in RAM so our CPU can process it. When you see a new phone or laptop that says it has 16 gigs of RAM, that means it can run up to 16 gigs of programs, meaning you can run lots of programs at the same time. When you type a document, you're using RAM.

If you've ever had the misfortune of working on an important presentation or paper and losing power, you know the feeling you get when all of the work you've done is lost. It's a total bummer. This happens to anything with RAM, even video games. Have you ever gone on a long campaign without saving, then right as you get to a safe point, the power goes off on the console and all the progressyou've made is lost forever? It's not fun at all. You spend the next hour or so deciding whether or not just to rage quit the game completely and start all over from scratch. Not that this happened to me or anything. That was just a friend. 😅

Anyway, all of this happens because RAM clears its data when powered off. There are lots of types of RAM, and the one that's commonly found in computers is DRAM or dynamic random-access memory. When 1 or 0 is sent to DRAM, it stores each bit in a microscopic capacitor. This is either charged or discharged, represented by 1 or a 0. These semiconductors are put into chips that are on the RAM and store our data. There are also different types of memory sticks that DRAM chips can be put on. The more modern DIMM sticks, which usually stands for Dual Inline Memory Module, have different sizes of pins on them.

I should call out that we don't really buy RAM based on the number of DRAM chips they have. They're labeled by the capacity of RAM on a stick, like an eight-gig stick of RAM. After DRAM was created, RAM manufacturers built something called SD RAM, which stands for synchronous DRAM. This type of RAM is synchronized to our system's clock speed, allowing quicker processing of data.

In today's systems, we use another type of RAM called double data rate SDRAM or DDR SDRAM for short. Most people refer to this RAM as DDR, even shorter. There are lots of iterations of DDR, from DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and now, DDR4. DDR is faster, takes up less power, and has a larger capacity than earlier SD RAM versions. The latest version, DDR4, is the fastest type of short-term memory currently available for your computer. And faster RAM means that programs can be run faster and that more programs can run at the same time.

Keep in mind that any RAM sticks you use need a compatible motherboard with a different number of pins aligned with the motherboard RAM slots. Just like with the CPU, make sure that your motherboard is compatible with any RAM sticks that you buy.
