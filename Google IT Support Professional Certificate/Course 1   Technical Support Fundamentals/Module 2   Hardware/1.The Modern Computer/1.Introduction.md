# 🚀 The Fascinating Journey of Computers

### 🕰️ A Glimpse into Computer History

Isn't the **history of computers** incredibly fascinating? It’s amazing to look back and see how we’ve evolved to this exciting point in computing. You’ve already started building your IT foundation, so before we go deeper, let me introduce myself.

### 👋 Meet Your Guide: Devan Sri-Tharan

Hi! My name is **Devan Sri-Tharan**, and I’ve been working in IT for **10 years**. I currently work as a **Corporate Operations Engineer** at Google, where I tackle challenging and complex IT issues. 

My love for technology started at around **nine years old** when my dad brought home our first computer. He handed me a floppy disk and told me it had a game on it. To his surprise, I managed to copy the game from the disk onto the computer’s hard drive! While this may seem like a simple task now, it was a big moment back then.

### 🎮 The Spark of Passion

Sure, I loved playing the games, but what truly excited me was **tinkering with the machine**, trying to get it to do what I wanted. This first experience with a computer ignited my passion for technology, but my career really began to take shape through my **early job experiences**.

I worked in retail selling baby furniture and at a postal store where I not only helped customers ship packages but also served as the go-to IT support for the shop. It may sound strange, but **working in retail** is what truly inspired my career in IT. I found that I enjoyed communicating with customers, understanding their needs, and offering solutions.

### 💼 First Steps in IT

My first IT job was as an **IT support specialist intern** in college. Later, I worked as an IT consultant, where I helped decommission an entire IT environment. This was my first experience working with large IT infrastructures and pushing myself outside my comfort zone as a college student.

### 🔧 Lessons from Experience

These early jobs shaped my IT career. I knew I wanted to be in tech, but I wasn’t sure which path to take. Starting at Google as an **IT generalist** allowed me to explore many different areas of technology. It helped me figure out the jobs I didn’t want to do, which was crucial in finding out what I was truly passionate about.

### 💻 My Passion: IT Infrastructure

I am deeply passionate about **IT infrastructure**, but you can’t fully understand infrastructure until you have a solid understanding of **hardware**. In IT, hardware is essential knowledge. You might find yourself replacing faulty components or even upgrading an entire fleet of machines. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to describe all the physical parts of a computer, how they work together, and even build your own computer!
