## üñ•Ô∏è **Windows Resource Monitoring**

In an IT support role, managing processes is essential, particularly when system processes become unstable or resource-heavy. Windows provides tools to monitor system resources, including **Resource Monitor** and **Get-Process** via PowerShell. Below is a breakdown of how these tools work.

### üîç **Resource Monitor**

Resource Monitor provides a graphical interface to observe system resources and manage processes. It offers five main tabs:

1. **Overview** - Displays an overview of all system resources.
2. **CPU** - Information about CPU usage by processes.
3. **Memory** - Data on how processes utilize system memory.
4. **Disk** - Monitoring of disk activity per process.
5. **Network** - Details on network activity by processes.

Each tab shows processes and their resource consumption, such as CPU usage, memory (indicated by Private Bytes), and disk IO (input/output).

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Command-Line Resource Monitoring**

For users who prefer the command line, **PowerShell** offers the `Get-Process` command. This command retrieves detailed information about each running process, including non-paged memory (NPMK) in kilobytes (K). To further refine the information, users can filter processes using pipes (`|`) and sorting commands. Here‚Äôs an example of how to display the top 3 CPU-consuming processes:

```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 3 -Property ID, ProcessName, CPU
```

### üí° **Explanation of Command**

- `Get-Process` ‚Äì Retrieves all running processes.
- `| Sort-Object CPU -Descending` ‚Äì Sorts processes by CPU usage in descending order.
- `| Select-Object -First 3 -Property ID, ProcessName, CPU` ‚Äì Displays only the top three processes based on CPU usage, showing their ID, name, and CPU consumption.

### üìà **Process Explorer**

In addition to Resource Monitor, Windows also offers **Process Explorer** to visualize process performance. By selecting a process and viewing its properties, users can see real-time performance graphs of:

- **CPU** activity.
- **Memory** usage (Private Bytes).
- **Disk IO** activity.

### üß† **Key Takeaways**

- **Resource Monitor** provides a graphical way to manage processes.
- **PowerShell's Get-Process** allows command-line resource monitoring and filtering.
- **Process Explorer** offers detailed performance insights for each process.
- Effective process management helps troubleshoot performance issues and optimize resource use.

## üêß **Linux Resource Monitoring**

In **Linux**, several commands allow you to monitor system utilization and manage processes effectively. Understanding and using these commands is crucial for troubleshooting performance issues. Below is a breakdown of key commands and how they help manage system resources.

### üìä **`top` Command**

The `top` command provides real-time monitoring of system resources. It displays the top processes consuming the most resources, offering insights into:

- **Total tasks**: Running or idle.
- **CPU usage**: Percentage of CPU resources being used.
- **Memory usage**: Percentage of memory resources used by each task.

#### Key Fields:
- **%CPU**: Shows the CPU usage of individual tasks.
- **%MEM**: Shows the memory usage of individual tasks.

**Usage Tip**: Press `q` to exit the `top` command.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Common Scenario: High Resource Usage**

When a computer is running slowly, it‚Äôs often due to **overuse of hardware resources**. Use `top` to identify any tasks with high CPU or memory usage. If necessary, you can investigate or terminate these processes to free up resources.

### ‚è≤Ô∏è **`uptime` Command**

The `uptime` command provides essential system information, including:

- **Current time**.
- **How long the system has been running**.
- **Number of logged-in users**.
- **System load averages**: Displays CPU load over the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

This is useful for assessing system performance over time, especially when monitoring load fluctuations.

### üìÇ **`lsof` Command**

The `lsof` (List Open Files) command helps track processes that are using files. For example, if you can‚Äôt eject a USB drive because the system reports "device or resource busy," `lsof` can identify which processes are holding open files on the device.

```bash
lsof | grep /path/to/device
```

This command is highly effective for managing open files and resolving issues like blocked USB ejection.

### üíª **Hardware Monitoring**

If you‚Äôre interested in monitoring CPU or memory usage independently of processes, Linux offers various commands for that purpose. These may not be critical for single-machine monitoring, but they become valuable when managing **multiple machines** or a fleet of systems.

### üß† **Key Takeaways**

- The **`top`** command is invaluable for real-time process monitoring.
- **`uptime`** provides load averages to track system performance over time.
- Use **`lsof`** to troubleshoot open file issues, especially with removable drives.
- Monitoring hardware separately from processes can be useful for system administrators managing many machines.
