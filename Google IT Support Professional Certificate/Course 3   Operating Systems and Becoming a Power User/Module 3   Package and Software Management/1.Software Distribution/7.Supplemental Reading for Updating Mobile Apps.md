### 📱 Mobile App Updates: Best Practices for IT Support 📱

Maintaining up-to-date apps on mobile devices is critical for security and performance. IT Support professionals should know how to update apps on both Android and Apple devices to ensure smooth operation and prevent issues related to outdated apps. Here's a scientific breakdown of updating apps on mobile devices:

#### 🔄 How to Update Apps

#### Android Mobile Apps
**Android** is an open-source OS, meaning mobile device manufacturers and carriers can modify it. This can affect how system settings are accessed, so if you can’t locate certain settings (like **Storage**), it’s best to consult the device manual.

##### Automatic Updates for Android 📥
1. Open the **Google Play Store** app.
2. Tap the **profile icon** at the top right.
3. Go to **Settings**.
4. Open **Network preferences**.
5. Choose one of the following options:
   - **Over any network** (Wi-Fi or mobile data).
   - **Over Wi-Fi only** (recommended to avoid data charges).
   
💡 *Troubleshooting tip*: Ensure the user is logged into their Google account; otherwise, automatic updates may fail.

##### Manual Updates for Android 🔄
1. Disable automatic updates via the **Network preferences** in **Settings**.
2. Open the **Google Play Store** app.
3. Tap the **profile icon**.
4. Select **Manage apps & device**.
5. Under **Update available**, tap **See details**.
6. Select individual apps to **Update**.

#### Apple Mobile Devices 🍏

##### Automatic Updates for Apple Devices 🛠️
By default, Apple devices (iPhones and iPads) automatically update installed apps. However, IT professionals may need to re-enable automatic updates if they were disabled. Follow Apple’s guidelines for the specific OS version to toggle this setting.

##### Manual Updates for Apple Devices 🔧
In organizations that require testing app updates before deployment, manual updates might be preferred:
1. Disable automatic updates to enable notifications for manual updates.
2. This step allows administrators to review app updates before applying them across all devices.

💡 *Note*: Instructions vary by **OS version**. Refer to Apple’s website for the correct instructions based on the device’s OS.
