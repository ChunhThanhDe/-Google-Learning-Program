# Viewing User and Group Information in Windows


## Computer Management Tool

To view user and group information in Windows, we will use the **Computer Management** tool.

1. Search for "Computer Management" in the application search and open it.
2. The window that appears provides a lot of useful information. We'll be using this application a lot throughout this course, so let's take some time to go over it.

### Local vs. Domain Management

- At the top of the sidebar, you'll see it says "Computer Management (Local)". This means we're managing a single machine locally.
- In an enterprise environment, you can manage multiple machines in something called a **Windows Domain**. A Windows Domain is a network of computers, users, files, etc. that are added to a central database. If you're an admin of that domain, you can view those accounts and computers from any machine in the domain.

### Exploring the Submenus

Let's do a rundown of each of the submenus under "Computer Management":

🗓️ **Task Scheduler**: Lets you schedule programs and tasks to run at certain times, like automatically shutting off the computer at 11:00 PM every night.

📜 **Event Viewer**: This is where the system stores its system logs.

📂 **Shared Folders**: Shows the folders that different users on the machine share with each other.

👥 **Local Users and Groups**: This is where we'll be doing our user and group management.

⚙️ **Performance**: Shows monitoring for the resources of our machine, like CPU and RAM.

🔌 **Device Manager**: Manage devices connected to the computer, like network cards, sound cards, monitors, and more.

💾 **Disk Management**: Manage the storage devices and volumes on the computer.

🛠️ **Services and Applications**: Shows the programs and services available on the system.

## Exploring User and Group Information

Let's go to the **Local Users and Groups** menu to see what kind of user account we have and which groups we're a part of.

### User Accounts

- Under the "Users" folder, we can see the built-in Windows accounts, like **Guest** and **Administrator**.
- The local **Administrator** account allows you to log in with the administrator username and password. This account is disabled by default, as it has unfettered access to the computer, which can be dangerous.
- Let's look at the account I'm in, **Cindy**. Double-click on it to see more information.

### User Account Details

- The **General** tab shows basic information about the user and options like "User must change password at next login", "User cannot change password", and "Password never expires".
- The **Member Of** tab shows the groups this user is a part of. I can see that I'm in the **Administrators** group.
- The **Profile** tab allows you to change settings about the user's profile, like the home folder location. This is more important when managing many users on a domain.

### Group Information

- In the "Groups" folder, we can view the available groups and their members.

Now that we've explored the GUI way of viewing user and group information, let's take a look at how to do the same thing using the Windows CLI.

# Checking Local Administrator Accounts with PowerShell 🕹️

## The Scenario 🤔
Imagine you're working as an IT Support Specialist at a company and your boss asks you to check all the user information on 10 machines to make sure that the local administrator account is not enabled. 🖥️👨‍💻

## The Manual Way 🐢
Sure, you could search Computer Management in the search bar, click Computer Management Local, look under System Tools, click on local users and groups, then double-click on the username of the computer to ensure that their local administrator account isn't enabled. Now you just have to do that nine more times. There's a much faster way. 🤦‍♂️

## The Fast Way with PowerShell ⚡
You can just use the CLI to quickly see the list of users on the computer using the command, `Get-LocalUser`. As you can see, it lists my user account, a few other users, and a couple of other default accounts that are part of windows. Here you can see that my local administrator account isn't enabled. That's way easier. 💻

### Checking Groups 🔍
What about groups? I bet you can guess, `Get-LocalGroup` will list the groups on the local machine. There are a whole bunch of groups, but don't worry, these are all built-in groups. Each of them are important, but we aren't likely to make changes to most of them. 🤖

#### The Administrators Group 🔑
One that we will make changes to is the administrators group. Remember, this group controls who has administrative access to the machine. It's important to know who's in this group since anyone in this group can make any change they want to the machine. We just saw in the GUI that we're in this group. But I wonder who else is? : Let's see who's in this group with `Get-LocalGroupMember`, and I want to check the administrators group. We can see that the administrator user and my user are in the administrators group, but no one else. It looks good to me. 👨‍💻

### A Few Notes ⚠️
One last note, these local user and group PowerShell commands require that you're running PowerShell 5.1 or newer. You may have noticed that I keep saying local accounts and local users. If your organization has a lot of windows machines, it's very common to use Active Directory to manage user accounts in a central directory service. 🌐
