# Window: Managing User Accounts in Linux 👥💻


## Adding New User Accounts 🆕👤
To add a new user, we'll use the computer management tool. Under "Local Users and Groups", right-click and select "New User". 🖱️

Here, we'll set a username, full name, and a default password. Remember to check the "User must change password at next logon" box to ensure good password practices. 🔒

Let's create a new user account for Elizabeth. 💻

## Deleting User Accounts 🗑️👤
To remove a user, right-click on their account and select "Delete". 🖱️

This will give a warning that user names are unique, and even if you delete the user and give them the same name, they won't be able to access their old resources. 🚫

## Command Line User Management 💻🔤
You can also manage user accounts using the command line. 

To add a new user using the `net` command, use the `/add` parameter:
```
net user andrea * /add
```

To flag the user's account to require a password change at next login, use the `/logonpasswordchange:yes` parameter:
```
net user andrea /logonpasswordchange:yes
```

You can combine these commands to create a new account that requires a password change on first login:
```
net user cesar "a password" /add /logonpasswordchg:yes
```

To delete a user account, use the `/delete` parameter:
```
net user andrea /delete
```

Alternatively, you can use the `Remove-LocalUser` PowerShell cmdlet to delete accounts:
```
Remove-LocalUser -Name Cesar
```

Remember, as you learn new CLI commands, you'll start to notice patterns that can help you discover and remember new ways to manage user accounts. 🤓💻

# Managing User Accounts in Linux 👥💻

## Adding New User Accounts 🆕👤
To add a new user in Linux, you can use the `useradd` command:

```
sudo useradd juan
```

This will set up the basic configurations for the user and create a home directory. 🏠

You can also combine this with the `passwd` command to make the user change their password on first login:

```
sudo useradd juan
sudo passwd juan
```

## Deleting User Accounts 🗑️👤
To remove a user, you can use the `userdel` command:

```
sudo userdel juan
```

And just like that, the user is no longer on the list. 📜

Great work! 👏💻
