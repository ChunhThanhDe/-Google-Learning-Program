## Windows Filesystem Repair 🛠️

#### **Importance of Proper Ejection**

- **Why Eject?**: Properly ejecting or unmounting a USB drive ensures all data has been written from the buffer to the drive. Removing the drive too soon can cause data corruption. 📉
- **Buffer Role**: Data is first copied to a buffer (a region of RAM) before being written to the disk. If the buffer is not flushed properly, data may be lost or corrupted. 🗂️

#### **Handling Data Corruption**

- **Causes**:
  - **Power Failures**: Sudden shutdowns can lead to data corruption.
  - **System Failures**: Software bugs or crashes can corrupt data. ⚡
  
#### **NTFS Features for Recovery**

1. **Journaling**:
   - **Function**: Logs changes to file metadata in the NTFS Log.
   - **Benefit**: Helps recover the file system to a consistent state after corruption by referencing the log. 📜

2. **Self-Healing**:
   - **Function**: Automatically fixes minor issues and corruption in the background while Windows is running.
   - **Checking Status**: Use the command `fsutil repair query C:` to check self-healing status. 🔍

3. **Check Disk Utility**:
   - **Function**: Repairs serious disk corruption, such as bad sectors or disk failures.
   - **Usage**:
     - **Read-Only Mode**: `chkdsk` command provides a report without making changes.
     - **Fix Issues**: Use `chkdsk /F` to automatically fix problems. 🛠️
     - **Specify Drive**: For example, `chkdsk D: /F` to check and fix the D: drive.

- **Automatic Checks**: Windows sets a bit in a metadata file to indicate corruption. During boot, `chkdsk` will check this bit and attempt repairs if necessary. 🔄

Windows NTFS provides robust mechanisms to handle and recover from file system corruption, making it resilient against data loss and disk issues. 🌟
