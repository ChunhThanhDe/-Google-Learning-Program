# Linux Mounting and Unmounting a Filesystem 🐧📂

#### 🔄 **Mounting a Filesystem**

- **Objective**: To interact with a disk, you need to mount its filesystem to a directory.
- **Why Not Direct Access?**:
  - You can't `cd` into a device file (e.g., `/dev/sdb`) because it's not a directory but a device node.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Create a Mount Point**:
     - Example: `sudo mkdir /mnt/my_usb`
  2. **Mount the Filesystem**:
     - Command: `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/my_usb`
  - This allows you to read from and write to the disk through `/mnt/my_usb`.

#### 🔄 **Unmounting a Filesystem**

- **Objective**: To safely disconnect a disk or remove its filesystem.
- **Steps**:
  - Command: `sudo umount /mnt/my_usb` or `sudo umount /dev/sdb1`
  - It's crucial to unmount before physically disconnecting the drive to avoid file system errors.

#### ⚙️ **Automatic Mounting**

- **Temporary Mount Points**:
  - Created with the `mount` command; they disappear after reboot.
- **Permanent Mounting**:
  - Modify `/etc/fstab` to automatically mount filesystems at boot.
  - **Steps**:
    1. **Get UUID**: Use `sudo blkid` to find the UUID of your device.
    2. **Edit `/etc/fstab`**:
       - Add an entry with the UUID, mount point, filesystem type, and options.
       - Example entry: `UUID=your-uuid /mnt/my_usb ext4 defaults 0 2`

#### ⚠️ **Cautions**

- **Unmounting**: Always unmount before disconnecting to prevent data corruption.
- **Temporary Mount Points**: Disappear on reboot; use `/etc/fstab` for permanent mounts.

#### 🛠️ **Summary**

1. **Mounting**: Create a directory and use `mount` to access the filesystem.
2. **Unmounting**: Use `umount` to safely disconnect.
3. **Automatic Mounting**: Modify `/etc/fstab` to ensure automatic mounting on boot.

By following these steps, you can manage disk filesystems efficiently and avoid common issues related to data access and integrity. 🚀🖥️

#### 🔄 **Mounting and Unmounting Filesystems**

- **Mounting**: Connects a physical storage device (e.g., hard drives, CD/DVD drives) to a directory in the filesystem, known as the mount point.
- **Unmounting**: Safely disconnects the filesystem from the mount point.

#### 🗃️ **File System Table (fstab)**

The **fstab** file simplifies the process of mounting and unmounting filesystems by automating the mounting of partitions during boot. It contains the following columns:

1. **Device**:
   - UUID or device name (e.g., `sda1`, `sdb1`).
2. **Mount Point**:
   - Directory where the device is mounted (e.g., `/mnt/my_usb`).
3. **File System Type**:
   - Linux file systems (e.g., `ext4`, `swap`, `ntfs`).
4. **Options**:
   - Mounting options (e.g., `rw`, `noexec`, `auto`).
5. **Backup Operation**:
   - Historically used for backups (now deprecated; use `0` for off and `1` for on).
6. **File System Check Order (fsck)**:
   - `0`: Do not check.
   - `1`: Check first (root filesystem).
   - `2`: Check after root filesystem.

**Example**:
```plaintext
<File System>  <Mount Point>  <Type>  <Options>  <Dump>  <Pass>
/dev/sda1      /              ext3    nouser     0       1
/dev/sda2      swap           swap   defaults   0       0
/dev/hda1      /mnt/shared    nfs    rw,noexec  0       2
```

#### ⚙️ **fstab Options**

- **sync/async**: Synchronous/asynchronous operations.
- **auto/noauto**: Auto-mount at boot.
- **dev/nodev**: Device driver use.
- **exec/noexec**: Binary execution.
- **ro/rw**: Read-only/read-write.
- **user/users/nouser**: User permissions for mounting.
- **defaults**: Use default settings (`rw`, `suid`, `dev`, `exec`, `auto`, `nouser`, `async`).

#### ✍️ **Editing the fstab Table**

**Steps**:
1. **Format and Partition the Drive**:
   - Use `fdisk` to format the drive with a compatible file system (e.g., `ext4`).
2. **Identify Block Devices**:
   - Use `lsblk` to list block devices and partitions.
   - Example output:
     ```plaintext
     NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
     sda     8:0    0  512G  0 disk 
     └─sda1  8:1    0  1G    0 part /boot
     sdb     8:16   0  1T    0 disk 
     └─sdb1  8:17   0  128G  0 part
     ```
3. **Edit the fstab File**:
   - Add new entry for the partition.
   - **Example**:
     ```plaintext
     <File System>  <Mount Point>  <Type>  <Options>  <Dump>  <Pass>
     /dev/sda1      /              ext3    nouser     0       1
     /dev/sdb1      /mnt/mystorage ext4    defaults   0       2
     ```
4. **Reboot**:
   - Check the mount point to ensure the new partition is available.

By understanding and using the fstab file effectively, IT professionals can manage disk mounting and unmounting tasks efficiently in Linux systems. 🔧💻
