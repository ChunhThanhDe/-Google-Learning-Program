### Windows: Mounting and Unmounting a Filesystem 🔌💾

#### 🗂️ **Mounting a Filesystem**

- **Definition**: Mounting a filesystem means making it accessible to the computer. This process allows the operating system to interact with the filesystem, enabling you to access files and directories.
- **Automatic Process**: In Windows, mounting is usually done automatically. For example, when you plug in a USB drive, Windows will recognize and mount it, making it available under the list of drives.
- **Access**: Once mounted, you can start using the USB drive immediately to read, write, and manage files.

#### 🚪 **Unmounting a Filesystem**

- **Definition**: Unmounting (or ejecting) a filesystem means safely disconnecting it from the computer. This ensures that all data is properly written and no files are in use, preventing data corruption.
- **Process**: To unmount a drive in Windows:
  - **Right-Click**: Locate the drive in File Explorer.
  - **Select Eject**: Right-click on the drive and select the "Eject" option.
- **Safety**: Always use the "Eject" option to safely unmount the drive before physically disconnecting it.

Understanding these processes helps in managing external storage devices effectively and safely. 🚀🔧
