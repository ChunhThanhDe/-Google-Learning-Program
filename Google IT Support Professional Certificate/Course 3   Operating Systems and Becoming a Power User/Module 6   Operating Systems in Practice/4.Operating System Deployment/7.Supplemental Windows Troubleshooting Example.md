### Troubleshooting a Full Hard Drive in Windows üñ•Ô∏èüíæ

**Problem Overview**: A common issue faced by IT support professionals is dealing with a full primary hard drive in Windows, which can cause various performance issues, such as slow operation, system hanging, or even OS failure. Proper maintenance and timely troubleshooting are crucial for avoiding these problems.

#### **Troubleshooting Steps** üîß

1. **Check Free Storage Space** üìâ
   - **Action**: Verify if the primary hard drive is full. Windows 10 recommends at least 20 GB of free space. If the drive has less than 5 GB, consider freeing up space.
   - **Recommended Space**: Aim for at least 15 GB of free space.

2. **Delete Temporary and Unneeded Files** üóëÔ∏è
   - **Tools**:
     - **Storage Sense**: Automatically cleans unnecessary files such as temporary files, offline cloud files, and files in the Recycle Bin. Configure it for proactive maintenance.
     - **Disk Cleanup**: Removes temporary files and offers a drive compression utility. If still facing low disk space, clear the cache for Microsoft Store .appx files.
   - **Note**: Clearing the Temp folder may be necessary if "Low Disk Space" issues persist.

3. **Reset Windows Update** üîÑ
   - **Action**: Use the Windows Update reset tool to resolve issues caused by incomplete updates. Check for missing or corrupted update files and service registrations.
   - **Location**: Find this tool under Settings > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters > Windows Update.

4. **Move Files to Alternative Storage** üíªüóÉÔ∏è
   - **Options**:
     - **Internal/External Storage**: Use additional internal hard drives or external storage devices like USB drives or SD cards.
     - **Network Storage**: Utilize Network Attached Storage (NAS) or Storage Area Networks (SANs) in network environments.
     - **Cloud Storage**: Services like OneDrive, Google Drive, etc., can be used, but they are less secure compared to local storage solutions.
   - **Setup**: In Windows System Storage settings, adjust the new drive as the destination for new content. Set cloud storage to online-only to avoid offline cache.

5. **Uninstall Unneeded Apps** üì¶
   - **Action**: Remove unnecessary applications, including Windows Store apps, to free up storage space.

6. **Run Antivirus and Antimalware Software** ü¶†
   - **Action**: Check for and remove any viruses or malware that might be filling up the hard drive with garbage data.

7. **Wipe Hard Drive and Reinstall OS** üîÑ
   - **Action**: As a last resort, wiping the hard drive and reinstalling the operating system can repair failed updates and resolve persistent performance issues.
