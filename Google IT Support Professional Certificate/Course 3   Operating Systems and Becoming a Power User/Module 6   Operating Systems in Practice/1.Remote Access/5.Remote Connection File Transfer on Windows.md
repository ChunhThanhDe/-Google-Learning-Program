## 🖥️ **Remote Connection: File Transfer on Windows**

### 🔄 **File Transfer with SCP in Windows**
Windows offers several methods for sharing files over a network. One approach is through **SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)** using the **PuTTY** toolset. The **PuTTY Secure Copy Client (pscp.exe)** works similarly to the **SCP command** in Linux.

- **Using pscp.exe**: You can copy files from a Windows computer to a **Linux workstation**.
  - Example command: Transfer files from your desktop to a specified location on a Linux system.
  
Once the file is transferred, you can verify it on the destination machine.

### 📂 **Windows Shared Folders**

Another convenient file-sharing method on Windows is through **Shared Folders**. This feature allows you to share files with individuals or groups on the same network, and it can be set up easily:

1. **Right-click** the folder you want to share.
2. Navigate to **"Share with"**.
3. Choose **specific people** or groups to grant access.

### ⚙️ **Mapping Shared Folders**
Once a folder is shared, it can be accessed from other computers:
- Open **This PC** and use the **Map Network Drive** option to directly link the folder.
- From another computer, you can access the shared folder using the **Run box**:
  ```bash
  \\computer-name\shared-folder-name
  ```

### 💻 **Command-Line Sharing with net share**
For advanced users, Windows provides the **net share** command to share folders directly from the command line. This method allows you to:
- **Specify permissions** for users or groups.
- Grant access using commands, such as:
  ```bash
  net share ShareMe=C:\path /grant:everyone,full
  ```
  This command grants full permissions to all users on the network for the folder **ShareMe**.

You can also list all currently shared folders by executing **net share** without any arguments:
```bash
net share
```

### 📜 **Key Takeaways**:
- **SCP** via **pscp.exe** is a secure method for transferring files between Windows and Linux.
- **Shared Folders** provide an easy way to share files on the same network.
- The **net share** command allows for more control over shared folder permissions and can be managed via the command line.
