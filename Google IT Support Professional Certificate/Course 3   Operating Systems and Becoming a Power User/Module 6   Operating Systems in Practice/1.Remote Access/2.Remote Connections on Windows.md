## üåê **Remote Connections on Windows**

In this lesson, we explore various methods for making **remote connections** on **Windows** computers, focusing on tools like **PuTTY** and the **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**.

### üñ•Ô∏è **Using PuTTY for Remote Connections**

**PuTTY** is a **free, open-source software** that allows you to make remote connections using various network protocols, including **SSH**. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Installation**:
   - You can download PuTTY from its official website as an **MSI** package (Microsoft Installer) or directly as an executable file (PuTTY.exe).
   - After installation, launch the PuTTY **GUI** to configure your connection.

2. **Connection Setup**:
   - Input the **host name** or **IP address** of the computer you want to connect to.
   - Default **SSH** port is set to **22**.
   - Click **open** to start the session and **SSH** into the remote computer.

3. **Command-Line Option**:
   - PuTTY can also be run from the **command line** or **PowerShell**.
   - Example command: `putty.exe -ssh user@ip_address -P port_number`.

4. **PuTTY Link (Plink)**:
   - **Plink** is another tool bundled with PuTTY for making SSH connections via the command line.

üí° **SSH (Secure Shell)** is especially useful for connecting from **Windows** to a **Linux-based** system.

### üñ±Ô∏è **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**

Windows also offers the **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** for graphical remote connections.

1. **Enabling RDP**:

   - Enable **RDP connections** for users on your network (ensure only trusted users have access due to security concerns üîí).

2. **Using RDP**:
   - You can launch the **RDP client** by typing `mstsc.exe` in the **Run** box or searching for **Remote Desktop Connection** in the Start menu.
   - Input the **name** or **IP address** of the remote machine to connect.

3. **Command-Line Launch**:
   - The RDP client can also be launched from the command line with additional parameters like `/admin` to connect with **administrative credentials**.

üíª **RDP Clients** are available for other operating systems like **Linux** (Real VNC) and **macOS** (Microsoft RDP).
