## 🖥️ **Virtual Machines**

### 📚 **What Are Virtual Machines?**
A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software emulation of a physical computer. It enables you to run multiple operating systems on a single machine, utilizing resources like RAM, CPU, and storage. In this lesson, we explore how to install, manage, and remove virtual machines using **VirtualBox**, a popular open-source virtualization software.

### 🛠️ **Setting Up a Virtual Machine**

To install a **virtual instance** (a single VM), follow these steps:
1. **Download VirtualBox** from the official site and install it.
2. **Download an OS image**, like Ubuntu, from its website.
3. Launch **VirtualBox** and click the **New** button to create a VM.
4. **Name your VM** and select the OS type (e.g., Ubuntu).
5. Allocate **RAM** for the VM (e.g., 1 GB is enough for simple tasks).
6. Allocate **hard drive space** (default 10 GB is sufficient).
7. Click **Create** to finalize the VM setup.
8. Select the **OS image** to install when starting the VM for the first time.

### 🔄 **Adjusting VM Resources**
One of the great features of VMs is the flexibility to modify hardware resources:
- To **increase RAM** or adjust other settings, simply:
  1. Right-click the VM.
  2. Select **Settings**.
  3. Adjust resources like RAM, storage, or network settings.

This is much easier than upgrading physical hardware on traditional machines.

### 🗑️ **Removing a Virtual Machine**
If you no longer need a VM:
1. **Right-click** the VM and choose **Remove**.
2. You can either remove it from the list or **delete all files** associated with it.

This process is much simpler than disposing of physical hardware!

### 💡 **Key Takeaways**:
- **VirtualBox** simplifies creating and managing VMs.
- You can easily adjust resources like RAM and storage to suit your needs.
- Removing a VM is as easy as right-clicking and selecting **Remove**—no hardware recycling needed!
