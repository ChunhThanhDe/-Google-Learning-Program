# Viewing and Editing Files

## Linux


### 📂 File and Directory Navigation
Now that we've learned the basics of file and directory navigation, let's learn how we can display and edit files, search for text within files and more.

#### 🔍 Viewing File Contents
In the Windows GUI, if we want to open a file and view its contents, we can just double-click on the file. Depending on the file type, it will open in a default application. In Windows, text files default to open in an application called Notepad. But we can change this if we want to.

#### ⚙️ Changing Default Application
To change the default application that opens files, just right-click and click "Properties". Under Open With, we can change the application to another text editor like WordPad. Most of the files that we'll be dealing with throughout this course will be texts and configuration files. Let's just focus on those files instead of images, music files, etc.

### 💻 Viewing Files in the Terminal
Viewing the contents of a file in PowerShell is simple using the `cat` command, which stands for concatenate. Let's give it a try. This will dump the contents of the file into our shell. This isn't the best solution for a file, since it just keeps writing the content until the whole file is displayed.

### 📖 Paging Through Files
If we want to view the contents of the file one page at a time, we can use the `more` command like this. The `more` command will get the contents of the file, but will pause once it fills the terminal window. Now we can advance the texts at our own pace. When we run the `more` command, we're launched into a separate program from the shell. This means that we interact with the `more` program with different keys.

#### 🔑 `more` Command Keys:
- `Enter`: Advances the file by one line
- `Space`: Advances the file by one page
- `Q`: Allows you to quit out of `more` and go back to your shell

### 🔝 Viewing the Head and Tail of Files
If we just wanted to quickly see what the first few lines of a text file are, we can use the `head` command with the `cat` command. This will show us the first 10 lines of a file. To view the last few lines or the tail of the file, we can use the `tail` command.

## 📜 Viewing Files in Bash

### 🐚 Using `cat` Command
To read a simple file in bash we can also use the `cat` command to view a document. So let's look at important document. The `cat` command is similar to the Windows `cat` command, but it doesn't do a great job at viewing large files. Instead, we use another command, `less`.

### 📖 Using `less` Command
`Less` does a similar thing that `more` does for Windows, but it has more functionality. Fun fact, there's a bash command called `More` but it's been slowly dying out in favor of `Less`. It's literally a case of "less is more". Similar to `more`, when we use `less` we're launched into an interactive shell.

#### 🔑 Common `less` Commands:
- 🔼🔽: Navigate up and down
- 🔼🔽: Page up and page down
- `g`: Move to the beginning of the file
- `G`: Move to the end of the file
- `/`: Search for a word or phrase
- `Q`: Quit `less` and go back to the shell

`Less` offers functionality like searching within a file, making it a great tool to use to view files of any size. You'll no doubt end up using this command often as an IT support specialist.

### 🔝 Viewing the Head and Tail of Files
Similar to the Windows `cat` and `head` parameter, we can do the same thing in Linux using a command called `head`. This will show you by default the first ten lines of the file. Now, what if you wanted to view the last few lines of the file? You can use a command called `tail`. This will show you by default the last ten lines of the file.
