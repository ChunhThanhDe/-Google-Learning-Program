# Navigating the Operating Systems 💻

## Introduction 👋

You've learned the basics of computing and just finished the bits and bytes of computer networking. Now it's time to explore the Windows and Linux operating systems! But first, let me introduce myself.

## Meet Cindy Quach 🙋‍♀️

I’m Cindy Quach, a Site Reliability Engineer at Google. My team manages Google's internal mobile fleet, including Android OS, iOS, and ChromeOS. I began my career as an IT support specialist and have spent seven years in IT, transitioning from systems administration to my current role.

## My Tech Journey 🚀

My journey into tech started in middle school, where I first interacted with computers. With limited resources, my brother and I got creative, assembling computers from old parts. Through trial and error, I built my first computer, sparking my passion for technology.

## Discovering a Career in Tech 💼

Initially, I didn’t think a tech career was possible. However, working as an IT support specialist in college opened my eyes to the field. My troubleshooting skills grew, but it wasn’t until I became a systems administrator on Google’s Linux team that I truly understood operating systems.

## Embracing the Command Line 💻

Joining a team of experts in open-source projects was intimidating, but I embraced the command line, which became second nature over time. With practice, I progressed from troubleshooting to contributing code to open-source software.

## What to Expect in This Course 🎯

This course is designed to make learning operating systems approachable. We’ll focus on practical aspects, including using Windows and Linux through the command line.

## Command Line Mastery 💪

Using the command line may seem daunting at first, but with guidance, you'll become proficient. Don’t hesitate to revisit lessons for a refresher!

## What You'll Learn 📚
