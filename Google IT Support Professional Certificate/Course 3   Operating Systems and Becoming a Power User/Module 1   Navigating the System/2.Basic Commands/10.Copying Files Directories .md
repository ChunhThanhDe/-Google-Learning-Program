# Window Copying Files and Directories in PowerShell

We've already created a few files and
directories but we need a couple more. We don't want to create
them all from scratch. So let's make copies instead. 🤖

In the Windows GUI, all you need to
do is right-click, copy, then paste. You can also use hotkeys if you want. 🔨

A hotkey is a keyboard shortcut that
does some sort of task in Windows. The hotkey for copy is `Ctrl-C` and
for paste, it's `Ctrl-V`. 🔑

In PowerShell,
the command used to copy something is `CP`. We also need to add a file
that we want to copy and the path of where we want to copy it to. Let's copy `mycoolfile.txt` to the desktop. 💾

There you can see `mycoolfile.txt`
was added to our desktop. 🖨️

## Using Wildcards to Copy Multiple Files 🌟

I have a few of these files I want to move
over but I'm feeling a little lazy and don't want to run this command over and
over again. So I'm going to use something called
the wildcard to help me copy over multiple files at once. 🤩

A wildcard is a character that's used
to help select files based on a certain pattern. 🔍

Let's say you want to get all the files
that were JPEGs and copy them somewhere. They go into my documents directory. I have files called `hotdog.jpg`,
`cotton_candy.jpg`, and `pretzel.jpg`. 🖼️

I need to come up with a pattern
to help me select all these files. What do they have in common besides
being named after delicious food? The `.jpg` extension. 🍔

Literally, anything else can be in
front of the `.jpg` file extension and it won't matter. That's what the wildcard asterisk `*` does.
It's the pattern for anything. 🌟

So I'm essentially saying select all
the files with the pattern `anything.jpg`. So to copy over all
the JPGs in the folder, I can use `cp *.jpg`
and the path I want to copy them to. 🔍

Let's just verify. There it is. Now instead of copying files one by one, we can use a single command
to get all the files we want. 👌

## Copying Directories with Contents 📂

For now, the only selector we'll
be using is the asterisk `*` for all. Next up,
let's say I want to copy over a directory. I'm going to try to copy a folder
called "Bird Pictures" to my desktop. 🐦

Let's just go back into Documents. There's "Bird Pictures",
now `cp "Bird Pictures" Desktop`. 

Now, this does exactly
what we told it to do. It copies the directory. However, This directory is empty. What it doesn't do is copy over
the contents of the directory. 🤔

To copy over the contents
of the directory, you need to use another command parameter,
`-Recurse`. 🔁

The `-Recurse` parameter lists
the contents of the directory. Then if there are any subdirectories
in that listing, it'll recurse or repeat the directory listing process for
each of those subdirectories. 📁

We'll need to use the `-Recurse` parameter
with `copy` to copy the contents of the directory along with
the directory itself. We're also going to use a new parameter,
`-Verbose`. 📋

`Copy` doesn't output anything to the CLI
by default unless there are errors. When we use `copy -Verbose`,
it'll output one line for each file the directory being copied. 💬

Let's give it a try. `cp "Bird Pictures" -Recurse -Verbose`. This just message says that we've
already copied Bird pictures. But what we didn't do was copy
over the files, which are now here. 🎉

Excellent, now the directory and
all the contents are copied to my desktop. 🖥️

# Linux

🗂️ Copying Files in Bash

In Bash, the exact same Windows command can be used for copying files. Take a look at this directory. Let's copy `my_very_cool_file.txt` to my desktop. 🖥️ There it is. We can also use the same asterisk wildcard to select patterns.

💻 Copying Files with Wildcards
Since this is similar to our Windows Copy command, what do you think we can use to copy over the `.png` files in this directory? I have files called `Pizza.png`, `Soda.png`, `Cake.png`. I can use `cp *.png`, then the desktop directory. 🖥️ Now if I look at my desktop again. There they are. The same copy rules apply in Bash.

📁 Copying Directories Recursively
If we want to copy over directory, we have to recursively copy over the directory to get all the contents. The flag for recursive copy is `-r`. If I want to copy over my cat pictures folder to the desktop, I could do something like this. 🖥️ There it is.
