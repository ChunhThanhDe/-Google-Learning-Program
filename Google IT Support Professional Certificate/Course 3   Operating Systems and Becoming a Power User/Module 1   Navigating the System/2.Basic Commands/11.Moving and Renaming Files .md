# Renaming and Moving Files in Bash 🔄 

We talked about making and copying files and directories so far. But what if we wanted to rename something that we created? 

## Windows

💫 Renaming Files
While in the Windows GUI, if you wanted to rename a file, we just right-click and rename. In the command line if we wanted to rename a file, we can use the `mv` (move) command. It lets us rename files. Let's move the file without changing the directory that it's stored in. On my desktop here I have `blue document` and I'm going to move or rename it to `yellow document`. 🖥️ Now you can see that I have a `yellow document`.

📁 Moving Files between Directories
As you might guess, the `mv` command also lets us move files from one directory to another. Let's move the `yellow document` into my `documents` directory and I can verify that, there it is. 🗂️ Cool. You can even move multiple files by using wildcards. Now you can see the rest of my colored documents went into my `documents` directory. 📂

🐧 Renaming and Moving Files in Linux

The exact same command can be used for Linux. `mv` or `move` can rename and move files and directories. Same thing applies here.

💫 Renaming Files
I'm going to move my `red document` and rename it to `blue document`. 🖥️ Now we can see it's been renamed to `blue document`.

📁 Moving Files between Directories
Then I'm going to move the `blue document` into the `Documents` folder. 🗂️ There it is.

🗃️ Moving Multiple Files with Wildcards
Using wildcards we can move multiple files at once, just like Windows. Let's move all that `_document` files here to our Desktop. 🖥️ Now if we check the Desktop, there they are.
