# Creating Directories

## Window

Now that we've covered listing
and changing directories, let's learn how to
add new directories.

 We can do this in the GUI
in a super simple way. Just right-click New, then Folder, and bam,
you have a new folder. 🗂️

### Creating Directories in the CLI 💻

Now what if we wanted
to do this in the CLI? In PowerShell, the command
to make a new directory is called `mkdir` or
`make directory`. Let's make a new
directory called `my_cool_folder`, there it is. That was easy. 😎

### Handling Spaces in Directory Names ⚠️

What if we wanted to
use spaces in our folder name instead
of underscores? What do you think would
happen if I did this instead? `Mkdir my cool folder`,
that's an error. `Mkdir` is trying to
interpret `cool` and `folder` as other parameters
to the `mkdir` command, it doesn't understand those
words are valid parameters.

Turns out that our shell doesn't interpret spaces the way we do. We need to tell it explicitly that this folder name
is one single thing. We can do this in
a variety of ways. We can surround the name
with quotes, like `mkdir "my cool folder"`, or we can escape
the space by using the back tick character `mkdir my\ cool\ folder`.

Escaping characters is
a pretty common concept when dealing with code. It means that the
next character after the back tick should
be treated literally. In our example, escaping
the space tells the shell that the space after the back tick is part
of our filename. While the back tick is the escape character
in PowerShell, other shells and programming
languages may use another character as
an escape character. 🐧

## Linux Creating Directories in Bash 🐧

### Making a New Directory with Spaces 🗂️

In Bash, the command to make a new directory is the
same as in Windows. Let's make a new
directory called `my cool folder` with the `mkdir`
or `make directory` command. Now we can verify `my cool
folder` is in our desktop. 💻

### Escaping Spaces in Bash 🔤

Instead of using backticks like in Windows to
escape a character, in Bash, you can
use a backslash. `mkdir my\ cool\ folder`

Similar to Windows, you can also use quotes to
encompass an entire file name. `mkdir "my cool folder"`

### Creating Directories with Spaces in Linux 🐧

How do you think you
would make a directory called `my cool folder`
in Linux with spaces? 🤔

`mkdir my\ cool\ folder`
Oh, there it is. 🎉

Or `mkdir "my cool folder"` works as well. 🙌

If you guessed
this, you're right. If you guess wrong, that's okay. Just re-watch this
video so you can get a better grasp of how we
came to this conclusion. 🎥
